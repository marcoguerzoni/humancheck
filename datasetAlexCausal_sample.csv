The results show that the efficiency of the whole industrial pollution control investment in Xinjiang is relatively low, and the investment DEA is not effective for industrial pollution and environment governance. Industrial pollution control investment efficiency level is low. This is mainly caused by the non-effectiveness of the pure technical efficiency prior to 2010 and the non-effectiveness of post-2010 scale efficiency. It means that the industrial pollution control investment and output structure prior to 2010 is irrational and the post-2010 scale efficiency is decreasing.

It is shown that, given a succession of three production cycles, the value of γ in the last cycle is determined by the equation 1+γ=(1+v)(1+k) where v is the growth rate of the profit share (α) in the last cycle while κ is a function of three variables: the income/capital ratio of the last cycle, the values of the savings rate in the first two cycles and those of the growth rate of the income/capital ratio in the last two. The equation just presented is also relevant for a succession of more than three production cycles for which the yearly values of r, g and α are known. Indeed, in this case it is possible to calculate the average values of γ and v from the empirical data, which then can be used in the equation to determine the average value of κ. Once the three variables are known, it is possible to calculate the parts attributable respectively to the average values of v and κ in the determination of the average value of γ. A similar result is obtained regarding the part attributable to the average changes in the savings rate and in the growth rate of the income/capital ratio, taken together, in the determination of the average value of κ. The paper also identifies those configurations of the relevant variables where γ > 0 out of which, when the succession of production cycles is long enough, results the inequality r > g.","2018","[('C61', 'B21'), ('C61', 'O40'), ('C61', 'E25'), ('C61', 'E22'), ('C61', 'E10'), ('C51', 'B21'), ('C51', 'O40'), ('C51', 'E25'), ('C51', 'E22'), ('C51', 'E10')]","['B21', 'C61', 'O40', 'E25', 'E22', 'E10', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.25","0.25","['B21', 'O40', 'E25', 'E22', 'E10']","['C61', 'C51']"

In meta‐analysis of diagnostic studies, accounting for this fact naturally leads to a trivariate expansion of the traditional bivariate logistic regression model with random study effects. In this paper, a new model is proposed using trivariate copulas and beta‐binomial marginal distributions for sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence as an expansion of the bivariate model. Two different copulas are used, the trivariate Gaussian copula and a trivariate vine copula based on the bivariate Plackett copula. This model has a closed‐form likelihood, so standard software (e.g., SAS PROC NLMIXED ) can be used. The results of a simulation study have shown that the copula models perform at least as good but frequently better than the standard model. The methods are illustrated by two examples.

To quantify the level of efficiency deviation of each market from the ‘ideal’ or ‘benchmark market of random walk’, we have constructed a Composite Electricity Market Efficiency Index (EMEI), inspired by similar works on other energy commodities. The proposed index consists of linear and nonlinear components each one measuring a different feature or dimension of the market efficiency such as its complexity, fractality, entropy, long-term memory or correlation, all connected to the associated benchmark values of the Random Walk Process (RWP). The key findings are that overall, all examined electricity markets are inefficient in respect to the weak form of EMH and the less inefficient market, as measured by the EMEI is the NordPool, closely followed by the Spanish market, with the Italian being the third. The most inefficient market is the Greek one. These results are in accordance with the predominant view about the maturity of these markets. This study contributes significantly on improving the research framework in developing consistent and robust tools for efficiency measurement, while the proposed index can be a valuable tool in designing improved guidelines towards enhancing the efficiency of electricity markets.","2019","[('C22', 'Q40'), ('C22', 'G10'), ('C22', 'L94'), ('C22', 'G20'), ('C15', 'Q40'), ('C15', 'G10'), ('C15', 'L94'), ('C15', 'G20'), ('C01', 'Q40'), ('C01', 'G10'), ('C01', 'L94'), ('C01', 'G20')]","['Q40', 'G10', 'C15', 'C22', 'L94', 'C01', 'G20']","False","True","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.5","['Q40', 'G10', 'L94', 'G20']","['C22', 'C15', 'C01']"

When this happens, a possible solution is to add bolt-ons. Finch et al. (Finch AP, Brazier JE, Mukuria C, Bjorner JB. An exploratory study on using principal component analysis and confirmatory factor analysis to identify bolt-on dimensions: the EQ-5D case study. Value Health 2017;10:1362–75) have recently shown that bolt-ons can be systematically identified using factor analysis. Nevertheless, because for each bolt-on option a complete re-evaluation may be required, methods to select between them are needed.ObjectivesTo investigate the possibility of selecting bolt-ons using their ability to predict differences in HRQOL. It tests six factors (energy/vitality, satisfaction, relationships, hearing, vision, and speech), and 37 items loading on them, using the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire as a case study.MethodsData were obtained from the Multi-Instrument Comparison study, an online survey on health and well-being measures carried out in six countries. Two tests were performed. In the first test, linear regressions were fitted to determine whether different bolt-ons helped explain variations in HRQOL as measured by the Health visual analogue scale. The upper anchor (100) of this scale represents excellent physical, mental, and social health, and the lower anchor (0) represents death. Bolt-on relevance was judged comparing the strength, direction, and statistical significance of unadjusted β coefficients. In the second test, linear regressions were fitted to further investigate whether different factors and items helped explain the negative effect of six chronic conditions on HRQOL. A reduction in the coefficients for the chronic condition dummies meant that the factor or item detected the effect.ResultsEnergy/vitality, relationships, and satisfaction reported substantially larger coefficients than did speech, vision, and hearing. Also, items loading on energy/vitality, relationships, and satisfaction generally presented larger coefficients than did those loading on speech, vision, and hearing. The second test did not detect consistent decrements in the coefficients for chronic conditions when testing factors, but it generally did detect consistent decrements when testing items.ConclusionsThe first test appeared useful for bolt-on selection. Further research is needed before using the second test.","2018","[('C93', 'I14'), ('C93', 'I12'), ('C93', 'I18'), ('C19', 'I14'), ('C19', 'I12'), ('C19', 'I18'), ('C13', 'I14'), ('C13', 'I12'), ('C13', 'I18'), ('C38', 'I14'), ('C38', 'I12'), ('C38', 'I18')]","['C93', 'I14', 'I12', 'I18', 'C19', 'C38', 'C13']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0119047619047619","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['I14', 'I12', 'I18']","['C93', 'C19', 'C13', 'C38']"

In particular, my analysis focuses on whether inflation targeting is based on a consumer price index (CPI) or its producer counterpart, producer price index (PPI). This issue is specifically relevant for transition economies as they might be subject to Balassa–Samuelson effects arising from trading in international markets. Under these circumstances, domestic inflation is possibly higher than imported inflation, hence targeting PPI inflation may prove more effective in influencing domestic macroeconomic variables than targeting CPI inflation. Using a Bayesian methodology, I find that the central banks of three Eastern European countries (namely, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland) are likely to target PPI inflation rather than CPI inflation. This result is in line with the theoretical predictions in the literature, and is robust across several Taylor-type rules.","2017","[('C11', 'F41'), ('C11', 'O52'), ('C11', 'E31'), ('C11', 'E52'), ('C11', 'E61'), ('C51', 'F41'), ('C51', 'O52'), ('C51', 'E31'), ('C51', 'E52'), ('C51', 'E61')]","['C11', 'F41', 'O52', 'E31', 'E52', 'E61', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['F41', 'O52', 'E31', 'E52', 'E61']","['C11', 'C51']"

MethodsFrom October 2009 to January 2010 we retrospectively analyzed patients admitted to ER and requiring troponin assays (troponin I AIA 360, TOSOH) according to hospital protocols and physician sight and we assessed the mortality at 90 days. Results1658 patients met the inclusion requirements, 227 (13,7%) of whom had a troponin above the cut off set by our internal procedure (0.06 ng/ml) at the sample collected just after the ER admission visit and were immediately handled according to initial diagnosis whereas 40 (2,4%) showed an above cut off troponin in a subsequent sample.The mortality at 90 days in the first group was 13,7% vs 7,5% in the last group (p<0,01).The 90-day mortality was higher in female (16,9%) and in patients suffering from disease other than acute coronary syndrome (23,5%), irrespectively of age and troponin levels above the cut off.

Using data on asset returns, I find that a positive investment shock leads to high marginal utility states. A general equilibrium model with investment shocks matches key features of macroeconomic quantities and asset prices.","2011","[('C15', 'E32'), ('C15', 'G14'), ('C15', 'D92'), ('C15', 'E22'), ('C15', 'G12'), ('C51', 'E32'), ('C51', 'G14'), ('C51', 'D92'), ('C51', 'E22'), ('C51', 'G12')]","['E32', 'C15', 'G14', 'D92', 'E22', 'C51', 'G12']","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","0.0","0.0","0.2","0.3333333333333333","['E32', 'G14', 'E22', 'G12']","['C15', 'C51']"

The analysis was conducted among the banking sector in the Republic of Macedonia for the period 2007-2015. The share of non-performing loans in total loans is one of the basic indicators for the quality of the credit portfolio in banks. The analysis of the movement and the level of non-performing loans is of great importance for identifying possible problems in bank risk management as a whole. With the application of correlation and regression method, we confirmed the findings of the consequences of non-performing loans on the performance of banks. The results indicate that a large share of non-performing loans to total loans leads to deterioration in the financial and liquidity position.

The results from the analysis indicated that on average, members of savings and credit cooperative societies used capital worth E 6185.00, compared to E 4520.00 that was used by non-members on crop production. Households who are members of savings and credit cooperative societies had an average maize yield of about 2.6 times that of households who are non-members. Similarly, average yields of potatoes for members is about 2.7 times those recorded by non-member households and average yields of beans of about 2.2 times than those obtained by non-members. The analysis reveals that households who are members of savings and credit cooperative societies produced more output per hectare of maize, sweet potatoes and beans than those households who are non-members. The high yields for members of savings and credit cooperative societies could be attributed to their ability to spend more on improved seeds, pesticides, fertilizers and other farm inputs. All the independent variables in the production model were found to explain 75.3% of the variation in the total amount of food crop produced by the farmers. The regression coefficient of capital used in food crop production indicates that all things being equal a 1% increase in capital used the value of food crops produced would increase by 0.34%, while a 1% in increase in labour and in land would result in 0.088% decrease and 1.027% increase in output respectively. The study has shown that savings and credit cooperatives play an important role in improving agricultural production. Hence there is a need to encourage farmers to join and save with cooperatives in order to have access to microfinance and improve their production through the use of improved seeds, technology and fertilizers.

Unlike the cointegrated VAR model, estimation and inference for the SSR model is complicated by a lack of closed-form expressions for the likelihood function and its derivatives. To overcome this, we introduce particle filter-based approximations of the log-likelihood function, sample score, and observed Information matrix. These enable us to approximate the ML estimator via stochastic approximation and to conduct inference via the approximated observed Information matrix. We conjecture the asymptotic properties of the ML estimator and conduct a simulation study to investigate the validity of the conjecture. Model diagnostics to assess model fit are considered.

Methods: Six hundred and twenty-one breast cancer patients were invited for a face-to-face interview in Qingdao Municipal Hospital, China. EQ-5D-5L was scored using tariffs from China, Japan, Korea, and the UK. The null hypothesis of normal distribution of the EQ-5D-5L utility score was tested by the Shapiro–Wilk test. Nonparametric Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to determine the difference among the four tariffs. The intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland–Altman plots were used to study the agreement among the four EQ-5D-5L scores. Known-groups validity was studied using a regression framework. Results: There were 608 participants in the final analysis, with a mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of 48.0±9.6 years. EQ-5D-5L utility scores were non-normally distributed. The means (median) ± SD of EQ-5D-5L utilities derived from Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and UK tariffs were 0.828 (0.879) ±0.184, 0.802 (0.823) ±0.164, 0.831 (0.829) ±0.137, and 0.838 (0.866) ±0.154, respectively. Among pairwise comparisons, the difference of median EQ-5D-5L utility scores was only insignificant between Chinese and UK tariffs. Excellent agreements (with ICCs >0.9) were found among the four tariffs albeit the limits of agreement between each pair of tariffs were wide. Known-groups validity was supported. Conclusion: Although four country-specific EQ-5D-5L tariffs have shown an overall high level of correlation and agreement, none of them could be regarded as interchangeable. The higher correlation and agreement between Chinese and UK tariffs may be due to the similar functions that were used in the tariff development. In the absence of Chinese-specific tariff, the UK tariff is the second-best option to be applied in the Chinese population. Results of this study further contribute to the explanation of variations among country-specific tariffs.

We find that when individuals are rational, the initial state determines whether the rule converges into a norm; when individuals are boundedly rational, convergence occurs only if upholding rules is a risk-dominant strategy. This suggests why big-bang reforms that affect only the initial state can fail, while gradualist approaches that can sustain the risk dominance of upholding rules may be more effective.","2011","[('C72', 'D02'), ('C72', 'P16'), ('C72', 'K00'), ('C72', 'D83'), ('C65', 'D02'), ('C65', 'P16'), ('C65', 'K00'), ('C65', 'D83'), ('C73', 'D02'), ('C73', 'P16'), ('C73', 'K00'), ('C73', 'D83')]","['C72', 'C65', 'P16', 'D02', 'K00', 'D83', 'C73']","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","0.0","0.0","","","['D02', 'P16', 'K00', 'D83']","['C72', 'C65', 'C73']"

In addition, there are policies belonging to the class with given Gini indices or passing through given points in the plane. In general, a transformation describing a realistic transfer policy has to be continuous. In this paper the results are generalized and the class of transfer policies is modified so that the members may be discontinuous. If there is an optimal policy which Lorenz dominates all policies in the class, it must be continuous. The necessary and sufficient conditions under which a given differentiable Lorenz curve can be generated by a member of a given class of transfer policies are obtained. These conditions are equivalent to the condition that the transformed variable stochastically dominates the initial variable X.

If the problem is reductions in taxation, then the reduction for a taxpayer can be considered as a new benefit.

Besides the description of the corporate debt market, the paper analyzes, by using co-integration and causality analysis, if there is long-term relationship between corporate debt market and Brazilian economic growth and the direction of the relationship. Additionally, the corporate debt market is compared to the banking market as complementary and competitive instrument of Brazilian productive financing. Tests suggest that there is significant co-integration between the variables under analysis and, in general, the corporate debt market is Granger-cause of economic growth, which means that there is significant influence of debt volume growth on stimulating economic growth. It was also verified that the corporate debt market seems to be more relevant than the banking market in influencing economic growth.","2011","[('C32', 'E23'), ('C32', 'O16'), ('C32', 'G30'), ('C32', 'E44'), ('C32', 'G20'), ('C51', 'E23'), ('C51', 'O16'), ('C51', 'G30'), ('C51', 'E44'), ('C51', 'G20')]","['E23', 'O16', 'C32', 'G30', 'E44', 'G20', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.1111111111111111","0.5416666666666666","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.1111111111111111","['E23', 'O16', 'G30', 'E44', 'G20']","['C32', 'C51']"

Despite the common opinion that entry barriers are always bad, the excessive number of firms means, all pros aside, duplicated fixed costs. It is shown that the socially effective number of firms is smaller than the equilibrium one for the wide spectre of demand and cost functions, and also for different strategies of companies’ behavior. This proposition is satisfied for the homogeneous product markets where output of each company decreases when the number of firms increases, and competition gets stronger. But there is the considerable danger of the increasing probability of collusion in a situation of number of firms limitation. We show that collusion is less dangerous than duplicated fixed costs if the gap between the «choke price» and marginal costs is less than a certain critical value connected with the share of fixed costs. The empirical research on the base of the financial statistics of the biggest world corporations of different industries is carried out.","2017","[('C72', 'L41'), ('C72', 'L11'), ('C72', 'D62'), ('C72', 'D43'), ('C72', 'L13'), ('C93', 'L41'), ('C93', 'L11'), ('C93', 'D62'), ('C93', 'D43'), ('C93', 'L13')]","['C72', 'C93', 'L41', 'L11', 'D62', 'D43', 'L13']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['L41', 'L11', 'D62', 'D43', 'L13']","['C72', 'C93']"

Design/methodology/approach – A quasi-experimental difference-in-difference estimation of treatment effects, using a matched sample of comparable untreated firms. Findings – Firms that have been granted counselling vouchers have a higher growth in value added than comparable untreated firms. This effect is mainly due to increased use of labour and capital, rather than increased efficiency. Results are upwardly biased due to sample selection among treated firms. Research limitations/implications – An improved strategy for identifying potential comparison firms from the pool of all firms may be necessary for further impact evaluations on business development programmes. Social implications – Policy makers may have to reconsider the programme design, since the programme currently suffer from a large potential for crowding-out, and low additional value of business counselling. Originality/value – The paper uses a matching procedure in order to infer causal effects of business counselling and compares the effect of, respectively, contamination and selection on estimated impact on firm growth and survival.

We find evidence of substantial deviations from the law of one price − product price differences between the cities averaged 76% over the period – a result that is consistent with the presence of large barriers to trade in the continent. Mean price differences across cities fell by close to a quarter over the period, but the decline was concentrated in the early 1990s with little progress subsequently, despite the regional trade policies implemented by the countries. Gravity-style estimates reveal that reductions in external tariffs and global trends towards price convergence in the early 1990s are the key contributors to the trend in price integration amongst the African cities.","2015","[('C23', 'R11'), ('C23', 'F14'), ('C23', 'F10'), ('C23', 'F15'), ('C23', 'O55'), ('C43', 'R11'), ('C43', 'F14'), ('C43', 'F10'), ('C43', 'F15'), ('C43', 'O55')]","['R11', 'F14', 'F10', 'C23', 'C43', 'F15', 'O55']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.1666666666666666","0.0608974358974358","0.0","0.0","0.2","0.4","['R11', 'F14', 'F10', 'F15', 'O55']","['C23', 'C43']"

So, first three types of non-reference Image Quality (IQ) metric, i.e., the contrast, the blur and the noise factors, are computed for each frame of an image sequence to describe the imaging definition. Then we use these discrete IQ data to form their time series data respectively. After that, we use the Detrend Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) technique to mine the laws of fluctuation of those series. Finally, the scaling exponents of the DFA can be used to represent and classify the intensity of fluctuation of the different air quality conditions.

Previous studies have reported similar results, which give rise to the puzzle that while local currency pricing is needed to account for incomplete import price pass-through, it would not imply a lower export price pass-through. Recent explanations of this puzzle have emphasized markup adjustment in response to exchange rate changes. This paper suggests an alternative explanation based on the presence of both producer and local currency pricing. Using a dynamic general equilibrium model, the paper shows that a mix of producer and local currency pricing can explain the pass-through evidence even with a constant markup. The model can also explain the observed exchange rate and inflation variability as well as the fact that the regression and VAR estimates tend to be similar.","2012","[('C32', 'F23'), ('C32', 'F41'), ('C32', 'E31'), ('C32', 'E52'), ('C32', 'F31'), ('C51', 'F23'), ('C51', 'F41'), ('C51', 'E31'), ('C51', 'E52'), ('C51', 'F31')]","['F23', 'C51', 'C32', 'F41', 'E31', 'E52', 'F31']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0345371974730699","0.1133775906728119","0.0666666666666666","0.2777777777777777","","","['F23', 'F41', 'E31', 'E52', 'F31']","['C32', 'C51']"

Streamlining shelter inputs and thus reducing shelter costs can include trading paid labor and management for fewer, more involved volunteers or purchasing large quantities of medical supplies from fewer vendors to take advantage of bulk-purchasing discounts. Beyond direct savings, time and energy spent on purchasing and inventory control can be reduced through careful management. Although cost-cutting measures may seem attractive, shelter managers are cautioned to consider the potential unintended consequences of short-term cost reduction measures that could limit revenues or increase costs in the future. This analysis illustrates an example of the impact of cost reductions in specific expense categories and the impact on shelter net revenue, as well as the share of expenses across categories.

We find that firms with higher media coverage in the current month have higher sustainable stock returns in the following months over a one-year period compared with those with lower media coverage, which means that media coverage has a more significant and positive influence on sustainable stock returns in the markets, dominated by individual/immature investors. These results are largely robust to various robustness checks. Further empirical results demonstrate that in the Chinese stock market, a higher level of media coverage might cause higher sustained investor attention, which may drive up the buying pressure and thus lead to higher sustainable stock returns in the following year. Our results show that the effect of media coverage on stock returns depends on the characteristics of investors.","2019","[('C22', 'G11'), ('C22', 'O16'), ('C22', 'M37'), ('C22', 'G41'), ('C22', 'G14'), ('C51', 'G11'), ('C51', 'O16'), ('C51', 'M37'), ('C51', 'G41'), ('C51', 'G14')]","['G11', 'O16', 'M37', 'G41', 'G14', 'C22', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.375","0.75","['G11', 'O16', 'M37', 'G41', 'G14']","['C22', 'C51']"

It is the key input for many financial topics including risk management, option and derivative pricing. One pressing computational hurdle in high frequency financial statistics is the tremendous amount of data and the optimization procedures that require computing power beyond the currently available desktop systems. In this article, we focus on the statistical inference problem on large volatility matrix using high-frequency financial data, and propose a regularization approach to achieve lower prediction errors. We also applied a hybrid parallelization solution to carry out efficient computations for high dimensional statistical methods via intra-day high-frequency data. A variety of hardware and software based HPC techniques, including parallel R, Intel Math Kernel Library, and automatic offloading to Intel Xeon Phi coprocessor are applied to speed up the statistical computations. Our numerical studies are based on high-frequency price data on stocks traded in New York Stock Exchange in 2013. The analysis results show that the constructed estimator using regularization approach generally achieves higher prediction power while enjoying faster convergence rate. We demonstrate significant performance improvement on statistical inference for high-frequency financial data by combining both software and hardware parallelism.","2015","[('C14', 'G13'), ('C14', 'G17'), ('C63', 'G13'), ('C63', 'G17'), ('C15', 'G13'), ('C15', 'G17'), ('C13', 'G13'), ('C13', 'G17'), ('C88', 'G13'), ('C88', 'G17')]","['C14', 'C63', 'G17', 'G13', 'C15', 'C13', 'C88']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['G13', 'G17']","['C14', 'C63', 'C15', 'C13', 'C88']"

We then use these results to demonstrate how the properties of prediction markets depend critically on the assumed homogeneity of participants.","2010","[('C53', 'D12'), ('C53', 'D84'), ('C53', 'G14'), ('C53', 'D81'), ('C02', 'D12'), ('C02', 'D84'), ('C02', 'G14'), ('C02', 'D81'), ('C11', 'D12'), ('C11', 'D84'), ('C11', 'G14'), ('C11', 'D81')]","['C11', 'D12', 'G14', 'C53', 'C02', 'D84', 'D81']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.1","0.4166666666666667","1.0","1.0","","","['D12', 'D84', 'G14', 'D81']","['C53', 'C02', 'C11']"

Because of price uncertainty, transportation agencies may face risks such as price speculation, inflated bids, very short-term price guarantees, and too few bidders for projects. Currently, various risk-management strategies, such as price-adjustment clauses, are used to control the consequences of uncertainty associated with the price of materials. Before implementing any risk-management strategy, it is necessary to ensure whether it is the proper time to use the strategy by measuring, analyzing, and forecasting the material price uncertainty. Transportation agencies need to regularly monitor the level of uncertainty in the price of asphalt cement to keep decisions about implementing their risk-management strategies current. However, there is little knowledge about quantifying and forecasting uncertainty in the price of asphalt cement. This gap in knowledge makes it difficult to recognize the proper time to implement risk-management strategies. The research objective of this paper is to measure, model, and forecast asphalt-cement price uncertainty. Autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) time-series models are used to quantify and forecast the uncertainties in the price of asphalt cement. The results of this study can help transportation agencies accurately recognize the proper time to implement risk-management strategies.","2017","[('C53', 'H54'), ('C53', 'R42'), ('C53', 'G32'), ('C53', 'L91'), ('C53', 'D81'), ('C32', 'H54'), ('C32', 'R42'), ('C32', 'G32'), ('C32', 'L91'), ('C32', 'D81')]","['H54', 'C32', 'R42', 'G32', 'C53', 'L91', 'D81']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['H54', 'R42', 'G32', 'L91', 'D81']","['C53', 'C32']"

We analyzed the 2010 financial statements of 98 large, urban safety net hospital systems in 34 states, supplemented with data on population demographics, hospital features, and state policies. We used multivariate regression to identify independent predictors of three outcomes: 1) Medicaid-reliant payer mix (hospitals for which at least 25% of hospital days are paid for by Medicaid); 2) safety net revenue-to-cost ratio (Medicaid and Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital payments and local government transfers, divided by charity care costs and Medicaid payment shortfall); and 3) operating margin. Medicaid-reliant payer mix was positively associated with more inclusive state Medicaid eligibility criteria and more minority patients. More inclusive Medicaid eligibility and higher Medicaid reimbursement rates positively predicted safety net revenue-to-cost ratio. University governance was the strongest positive predictor of operating margin. Safety net hospital financial performance varied considerably. Academic hospitals had higher operating margins, while more generous Medicaid eligibility and reimbursement policies improved hospitals’ ability to recoup costs. Institutional and state policies may outweigh patient demographics in the financial health of safety net hospitals.","2015","[('C10', 'I10'), ('C10', 'H75'), ('C10', 'R53'), ('C10', 'I18'), ('C10', 'H51'), ('C30', 'I10'), ('C30', 'H75'), ('C30', 'R53'), ('C30', 'I18'), ('C30', 'H51')]","['I10', 'H75', 'R53', 'I18', 'H51', 'C10', 'C30']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0173767752715121","0.0371343785876219","0.0","0.0902777777777777","0.0","0.0","['I10', 'H75', 'R53', 'I18', 'H51']","['C10', 'C30']"

In this paper, we propose a new set of indicators derived from the Annual Reports on Exchange Arrangements and Export Restrictions. Contrary to most earlier attempts to construct control indicators from this source, our set of indices allows one to analyze the control intensity separately for inflow, outflow and repatriation controls. An additional set of indicators features information on the institutional design of controls. At first glance, the data show that the financial crisis caused a surge in capital market restrictions, most notably concerning the derivatives market. This reflex, which is not justified by the scarce empirical evidence on the success of controls, shows the importance of having a valid measure to allow an econometrically sound policy evaluation in this field.

User behaviour at the time of parking was modelled to determine their willingness to pay in order to get to their final destination more quickly. Calculating willingness to pay is fundamental during the social and economic assessment of projects. It is important to correctly model how car parks and their users interact in order to get values which represent reality as closely as possible. Willingness to pay is calculated using a stated preference survey and by calibrating multinomial logit models, taking variable tastes into account. It is shown that a value with a low variability can be obtained for willingness to pay by correctly establishing the context of the choice and randomly changing the variables around an average value.","2009","[('C25', 'H54'), ('C25', 'R48'), ('C25', 'R41'), ('C25', 'D12'), ('C93', 'H54'), ('C93', 'R48'), ('C93', 'R41'), ('C93', 'D12'), ('C83', 'H54'), ('C83', 'R48'), ('C83', 'R41'), ('C83', 'D12')]","['C93', 'H54', 'D12', 'R48', 'R41', 'C25', 'C83']","True","True","True","True","True","True","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['H54', 'R48', 'R41', 'D12']","['C25', 'C93', 'C83']"

We used a hedonic pricing model to estimate the relationship between ‘Honeycrisp’ apple ( Malus × domestica ) quantities and prices by size category. This information was used to assess potential changes in grower returns as the grower shifts production toward certain size fruit. A grower would realize a loss of $5332/acre if production of size 48 to 88 count per 40-lb box decreased by 5% and size 100 to 163 count/box increased by 5% compared with current ‘Honeycrisp’ size distribution. In addition, we used experimental auctions to estimate consumers’ willingness-to-pay (WTP) for ‘Honeycrisp’ quality characteristics. Apple consumers, in this study, were willing to pay an average of $0.12/lb more for a one-unit increase in soluble solids concentration. A $0.12/lb discount for a decrease in soluble solids content (SSC) would represent a $1362/acre loss. Optimal sizes and SSC estimated in this study are linked with crop loads no larger than seven fruit/cm 2 trunk cross-sectional area under Washington state growing conditions. Given the increasing popularity of ‘Honeycrisp’, growers and allied industries should be aware of the importance of preserving the quality of this cultivar to maintain price premiums and thus profit margins.","2015","[('C93', 'D22'), ('C93', 'M31'), ('C93', 'Q11'), ('C93', 'Q13'), ('C51', 'D22'), ('C51', 'M31'), ('C51', 'Q11'), ('C51', 'Q13'), ('D12', 'D22'), ('D12', 'M31'), ('D12', 'Q11'), ('D12', 'Q13')]","['C93', 'D12', 'Q13', 'M31', 'D22', 'Q11', 'C51']","False","False","True","True","False","True","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.2916666666666666","['D22', 'M31', 'Q11', 'Q13']","['C93', 'C51', 'D12']"

However, no longitudinal data based on the health-related quality of life outcome from the EQ-5D instrument have been reported for orthopedic patients. We assessed the effect of orthopedic surgery as measured by EQ-5D. Methods We analyzed EQ-5D data from 2,444 patients who were operated at the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at Karolinska University Hospital, 2001–2005. We also made a comparison between results from this cohort and those from a Swedish EQ-5D population survey. Results The mean EQ-5D index score improved from 0.54 to 0.72. Hip and knee arthroplasty, operations related to previous surgery, trauma-related procedures, and rheumatoid arthritis surgeries had preoperative EQ-5D index scores of 0.48 to 0.52. All of these groups showed substantial improvement in scores (0.63 to 0.80). Patients with tumors or diseases of the elbow/hand showed higher preoperative scores (0.66 to 0.77), which were similar postoperatively. In most patients, the EQ-5D index score improved but did not reach the level reported for an age- and sex-matched population sample (mean difference = 0.11). Interpretation Our results can be used as part of the preoperative patient information to increase the level of patient awareness and cooperation, and to facilitate rehabilitation. In future it will be possible—but not easy—to use the EQ-5D instrument as a complementary consideration in clinical priority assessment.","2010","[('C80', 'H51'), ('C80', 'J14'), ('C80', 'I12'), ('C80', 'I10'), ('C10', 'H51'), ('C10', 'J14'), ('C10', 'I12'), ('C10', 'I10'), ('C40', 'H51'), ('C40', 'J14'), ('C40', 'I12'), ('C40', 'I10')]","['I10', 'C80', 'J14', 'I12', 'H51', 'C10', 'C40']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0416666666666666","0.1636904761904762","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['H51', 'J14', 'I12', 'I10']","['C80', 'C10', 'C40']"

Design/methodology/approach – A survey was mailed to the financial directors of manufacturing companies selected from the UK Financial Analysis Made Easy database. Factor analysis and multiple regression analysis were used to analyse the survey results. Findings – The findings reveal that SIDM is more complex and less systematic than the normative literature suggests, with a combination of contextual factors influencing the decision-making process. Further, the regression results suggest that SIDM is shaped by the interplay of procedural rationality, strategy formulation and political behaviour and that none of these on its own can sufficiently explain SIDM practice. Research limitations/implications – The survey data are drawn from UK manufacturing companies, so the findings may not be generalisable beyond that context. Practical implications – The findings suggest a need for firms to recognise that strategy formulation and political aspects of decision-making are as important as “rational” financial analysis in SIDM practice. Further, since SIDM practice is shaped by a combination of contextual factors, a comprehensive overview of these factors is necessary to direct SIDM outcomes. Originality/value – This study adds to the limited prior research examining the links between contextual factors and SIDM processes. Prior studies have tended to focus on only one dimension, or on limited factors, and have reported inconsistent findings. This paper provides a broader view of the complex nature of SIDM processes.","2013","[('C30', 'D21'), ('C30', 'M20'), ('C30', 'L20'), ('C30', 'D23'), ('C30', 'M10'), ('C10', 'D21'), ('C10', 'M20'), ('C10', 'L20'), ('C10', 'D23'), ('C10', 'M10')]","['D21', 'M20', 'L20', 'C30', 'C10', 'D23', 'M10']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['D21', 'M20', 'L20', 'D23', 'M10']","['C30', 'C10']"

Our political theory is based on the consent of the governed. Our legal system is built upon the argument that people freely make choices and bear responsibility for them. And what slogan could better express the heart of our consumer culture than Have it your way? In this provocative book, Kent Greenfield poses unsettling questions about the choices we make. What if they are more constrained and limited than we like to think? If we have less free will than we realize, what are the implications for us as individuals and for our society? To uncover the answers, Greenfield taps into scholarship on topics ranging from brain science to economics, political theory to sociology. His discoveries-told through an entertaining array of news events, personal anecdotes, crime stories, and legal decisions-confirm that many factors, conscious and unconscious, limit our free will. Worse, by failing to perceive them we leave ourselves open to manipulation. But Greenfield offers useful suggestions to help us become better decision makers as individuals, and to ensure that in our laws and public policy we acknowledge the complexity of choice.","2012","[('C93', 'I31'), ('C93', 'P16'), ('C93', 'D87'), ('C93', 'D03'), ('C93', 'K00'), ('B41', 'I31'), ('B41', 'P16'), ('B41', 'D87'), ('B41', 'D03'), ('B41', 'K00')]","['C93', 'B41', 'I31', 'P16', 'D87', 'D03', 'K00']","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","0.0","0.0","","","['I31', 'P16', 'D87', 'K00']","['C93', 'B41']"

The CWS index (Weiss &amp; Shanteau, 2003) is a coherence criterion that looks only at internal properties of the data without incorporating an external standard. In Experiment 1, college students (n = 20) carried out 2- and 3-digit addition and multiplication problems under time pressure. In Experiment 2, experienced golfers (n = 12), also college students, putted toward a target from nine different locations. Within each experiment, we analyzed the same responses using different methods. For the arithmetic tasks, accuracy information (mean absolute deviation from the correct answer, MAD) using a coherence criterion was available; for golf, accuracy information using a correspondence criterion (mean deviation from the target, also MAD) was available. We ranked the performances of the participants according to each measure, then compared the orders using Spearman’s r s . For mental calculation, the CWS order correlated moderately (r s =.46) with that of MAD. However, a different coherence criterion, degree of model fit, did not correlate with either CWS or accuracy. For putting, the ranking generated by CWS correlated .68 with that generated by MAD.

This paper shows that these restrictions are equivalent to a set of restrictions that are applied in the methods of Gonzalo and Ng and King et al . (KPSW). Using this result, it is shown that the Pagan and Pesaran method can be used to recover the structural shocks with permanent effects identically to those from the Gonzalo and Ng and KPSW methods. In the former case, this is illustrated in the context of Lettau and Ludvigson's consumption model and in the latter case in KPSW's six variable model.

In addition, many companies had adopted practices dedicated to ERM and consulting firms started to establish departments specialized in ERM. Meanwhile, universities have developed specializations related to ERM. Moreover, research centers embarked on research on this subject matter.
This study aims to investigate the reality of enterprise risk management in the Jordanian insurance industry in order to reveal the challenges facing it by focusing on the four most important dimensions related to enterprise risk management which are: governance and risk management strategy, risk culture, risk management operations and its interdependencies, and finally the support technology for risk management.
The study is based on the descriptive inductive methodology in building the questionnaire, which was distributed to a sample that consisted of most insurance companies in Jordan during the period from December 2015 to February 2016.
The study found that risk management practices and regulatory authorities have a long way to go, where the most important results of this study were:

28% of the insurance companies surveyed have a plan and a budget for Information Technology (IT) risk management.
The support level of technology to the risk management in the insurance companies surveyed is 30%.
33% of the insurance companies surveyed have standard practices in the enterprise risk management, such as: ISO 31000 and COSO standard.
33% of the insurance companies surveyed currently have a risk management system.
37% of the insurance companies surveyed were a target of electronic attacks over the past 18 months.
47% of the insurance companies surveyed have a risk management department that is responsible for adhering to regulatory and legislative requirements set by the legislator.
49% of the insurance companies surveyed, are evolving universities, consulting firms and specialized training centers, in developing and enhancing risk management personnel.
56% of the insurance companies surveyed are willing to have a risk management program
60% of the insurance companies surveyed have an accredited policy of risk management
The level of the risk management operations and its interdependence in the insurance companies is 64%
The level of the governance of risk management and its strategy in the insurance companies is 69%

Based on these results and in order to begin to improve the reality of risk management practices in the Jordanian insurance companies, the researcher has the following recommendations:

Activating the role of risk management through the establishment of specialized departments in this field.
Activating the role of the legislative and regulatory authorities to play a bigger role in order to confirm the existence of these departments and to improve procedures and instructions provided by these actors in this area.
Increasing the role of academia represented by universities, consulting firms and specialized training centers, to ensure improving the efficiency of the staff of risk departments.
Encouraging the companies through the regulatory authorities to adopt global standards in risk management, such as: ISO 31000 COSO standards.
Encouraging the companies to have a plan and a budget for the information technology risk management.
Directing companies to have accredited policies in risk management.
Drawing the attention of the companies to the importance of technology information in the risk management systems and the confidentiality of their information.
Drawing the attention of companies to raise the level of management in the governance and risk management strategies in the insurance companies.
Inducing to increase the level of risk management operations and its interdependencies among insurance companies.
Drawing the attention of researchers and academia to the importance of research and scientific studies in this area to demonstrate its importance to the Jordanian insurance companies, to increase the desire and willing of the insurance companies to adopt risk management programs, at present time and in the future.","2017","[('M10', 'G38'), ('M10', 'G22'), ('M10', 'G32'), ('M10', 'L22'), ('M10', 'M15'), ('C83', 'G38'), ('C83', 'G22'), ('C83', 'G32'), ('C83', 'L22'), ('C83', 'M15')]","['G38', 'G22', 'G32', 'L22', 'M15', 'M10', 'C83']","False","True","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['G38', 'G22', 'G32', 'L22', 'M15']","['M10', 'C83']"

The dealer activity, whereby two-sided liquidity is offered to a limited pool of clients, shares in common similarities with the market-making problem. The arrival flow of client orders is assumed random. The CLP offers a stream of two-way prices to its clients, which are functions of the amount traded by the client and the CLP holding. The concern is inventory risk, which increases for critically small or large numbers of held positions. The CLP controls its inventory by choosing the size and the skew of its spread, so to encourage, e.g. buy orders instead of sell orders. Furthermore, it can submit limit orders to standard exchanges, of which execution is uncertain, and market orders, which are expensive. In either case, the CLP risks information leakage, which is discouraged by a penalty for trading in standard exchanges. We numerically solve a double-obstacle impulse-control problem associated with the optimal management of the inventory. We observe that the CLP skews its spread before resorting to limit orders, and ultimately crosses the spread in the standard exchange. We learn that it is optimal to post limit orders deeper in the book when the inventory is relatively small and to progressively move towards the best price as the inventory increases. The CLP adjusts its pricing-hedging strategy according to its profit and losses (P&L) target, a feature we analyse by considering various degrees of the CLP’s risk appetite.","2017","[('C61', 'G13'), ('C61', 'D53'), ('C61', 'G11'), ('C61', 'G23'), ('C63', 'G13'), ('C63', 'D53'), ('C63', 'G11'), ('C63', 'G23'), ('C73', 'G13'), ('C73', 'D53'), ('C73', 'G11'), ('C73', 'G23')]","['C61', 'G23', 'G11', 'C63', 'G13', 'D53', 'C73']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0119047619047619","0.0192307692307692","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['G13', 'D53', 'G11', 'G23']","['C61', 'C63', 'C73']"

They investigate the predictors of settlement before the arbitration hearing and then estimate models for the likelihood of employee wins and damage amounts for the 2,802 cases that resulted in an award. Their findings show that larger-scale employers who are involved in more arbitration cases tend to have higher win rates and have lower damage awards made against them. This study also provides evidence of a significant repeat employer-arbitrator pair effect; employers that use the same arbitrator on multiple occasions win more often and have lower damages awarded against them than do employers appearing before an arbitrator for the first time. The authors find that self-represented employees tend to settle cases less often, win cases that proceed to a hearing less often, and receive lower damage awards. Female arbitrators and experienced professional labor arbitrators render awards in favor of employees less often than do male arbitrators and other arbitrators.","2015","[('C10', 'J70'), ('C10', 'K31'), ('C10', 'M51'), ('C10', 'J52'), ('C10', 'K40'), ('C40', 'J70'), ('C40', 'K31'), ('C40', 'M51'), ('C40', 'J52'), ('C40', 'K40')]","['J70', 'K31', 'M51', 'J52', 'C10', 'C40', 'K40']","True","True","False","False","False","False","0.0555555555555555","0.5","0.0","0.0","0.1666666666666666","0.5","['J70', 'K31', 'M51', 'J52', 'K40']","['C10', 'C40']"

Within contemporary neoliberal societies the development of a new division of labour leads to an improved role of management inside private industries and public services, also thanks to the new technologies.This means that management reaches a new essential status in the process of short-term capital gain, that is one of the main features of neoliberal capitalism into the era of globalization. One of the results of the new organization is that work loses its centrality, not only into the factories and the offices, but also among the entire society.

Some choice studies have moved beyond a focus on assumed representative, mean-level sensitivities toward a goal of representing the distribution of preferences across a sample. The mixed multinomial logit model has served as a valuable means of estimating such distributions of air travel preferences, including studies of business travelers, impacts of airport level-of-service attributes, distributions of willingness-to-pay (WTP), and information-processing strategies. Does the insight gained in previous studies, focusing on preferences in mature markets with relatively high per capita rates of air travel activity, apply to markets with low frequencies of airline patronage? This study centers on a survey of travelers in Tehran, Iran, a low-frequency air travel market. The analysis incorporates tests of a full range of distributions of random parameters to determine whether the impacts of restricting distributions allow only normality and confirms the potential to improve model fit with alternative distributions. The estimated distributions of WTP measures confirm the value of accounting for preference heterogeneity in the analysis of choice of air itinerary behavior in a low-frequency market and yield lower mean WTP values relative to analysis that omits the effects of preference heterogeneity.","2011","[('C25', 'L93'), ('C25', 'R41'), ('C25', 'O18'), ('C25', 'D12'), ('C93', 'L93'), ('C93', 'R41'), ('C93', 'O18'), ('C93', 'D12'), ('C51', 'L93'), ('C51', 'R41'), ('C51', 'O18'), ('C51', 'D12')]","['C93', 'D12', 'L93', 'R41', 'O18', 'C25', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.1878306878306878","0.324074074074074","0.0","0.0","","","['L93', 'R41', 'O18', 'D12']","['C25', 'C93', 'C51']"

Design/methodology/approach The authors utilize firm-level data from the Survey on Access to Finance of Enterprises for the period 2009-2013 conducted by the European Central Bank. Findings A negative association between the rating of sovereign creditworthiness and credit rationing is identified, while credit rationing varies substantially even among countries with the highest quality of sovereign bonds. Credit rationing is lower in sovereigns with high-quality ratings and higher in sovereigns near default. These results remain intact when fundamental firm characteristics (e.g. firm’s age and size, sector of economic activity, financial situation, etc.) are taken into consideration. This indicates that the interconnection of sovereign debt risk with domestic credit market outcomes is robust. Originality/value The present study contributes to the relevant literature by performing a detailed analysis of credit rationing for euro zone SMEs and by exploring the link between sovereign credit rating and credit rationing during the sovereign debt crisis period.","2017","[('C23', 'G32'), ('C23', 'D22'), ('C23', 'E44'), ('C23', 'G01'), ('C23', 'F36'), ('C33', 'G32'), ('C33', 'D22'), ('C33', 'E44'), ('C33', 'G01'), ('C33', 'F36')]","['F36', 'G32', 'D22', 'E44', 'C23', 'G01', 'C33']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.04","['G32', 'D22', 'E44', 'G01', 'F36']","['C23', 'C33']"

The use of high-frequency data limits the choice of the explanatory economic variables that can be included in empirical estimates. The first differences of GARCH(1,1) volatilities of share and bond price indices reflect portfolio trading decisions in corresponding markets for both assets. In the same vein, first differences of the gold price volatility, as an additional determinant, are related to exchange rate volatilities of two commodity currencies in the sample. The panel data estimates, using the Seemingly Unrelated Regression technique, produce coefficients with the expected signs and statistical significance.

Finally, ""… the relationship between knowledge and its social base is a dialectical one, that is, knowledge is a social product and knowledge is a factor in social change"" (p. 104). 2.

First, factor models based on large sets of macroeconomic variables for forecasting, which have generally proven useful for forecasting. However, there is some disagreement in the literature as to the appropriate method. Second, forecast methods based on mixed-frequency data sampling (MIDAS). This regression technique can take into account unbalanced datasets that emerge from publication lags of high- and low-frequency indicators, a problem practitioner have to cope with in real time. In this article, we introduce Factor MIDAS, an approach for nowcasting and forecasting low-frequency variables like gross domestic product (GDP) exploiting information in a large set of higher-frequency indicators. We consider three alternative MIDAS approaches (basic, smoothed and unrestricted) that provide harmonized projection methods that allow for a comparison of the alternative factor estimation methods with respect to nowcasting and forecasting. Common to all the factor estimation methods employed here is that they can handle unbalanced datasets, as typically faced in real-time forecast applications owing to publication lags. In particular, we focus on variants of static and dynamic principal components as well as Kalman filter estimates in state-space factor models. As an empirical illustration of the technique, we use a large monthly dataset of the German economy to nowcast and forecast quarterly GDP growth. We find that the factor estimation methods do not differ substantially, whereas the most parsimonious MIDAS projection performs best overall. Finally, quarterly models are in general outperformed by the Factor MIDAS models, which confirms the usefulness of the mixed-frequency techniques that can exploit timely information from business cycle indicators.","2010","[('C53', 'E37'), ('C53', 'E17'), ('C53', 'E27'), ('C32', 'E37'), ('C32', 'E17'), ('C32', 'E27'), ('C51', 'E37'), ('C51', 'E17'), ('C51', 'E27'), ('C38', 'E37'), ('C38', 'E17'), ('C38', 'E27')]","['C32', 'E37', 'C53', 'E17', 'E27', 'C38', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.1914230019493177","0.4166666666666666","0.0","0.5","0.0","0.75","['E37', 'E17', 'E27']","['C53', 'C32', 'C51', 'C38']"

More specifically, the paper looks at whether early signals are generated for forthcoming periods of negative and positive office rent growth. The analysis aims to complement structural model forecasting in the real estate market with short‐term forecasting techniques designed to predict turning points. Design/methodology/approach The objective of this study is achieved by deploying a probit model to examine the ability of economic sentiment indicator series to signal the direction of office rents and the strength of movement in this direction. The main advantage of this approach is that it is geared towards predicting turning points. Probit models are non‐linear in nature, and as such they can capture more effectively the likely asymmetric adjustments when turning points occur than linear methodologies would. The analysis is applied to three major office centres – La Défense, London City, and Frankfurt – to examine whether the results will differ by geography. Findings The findings reveal that the probit methodology utilising information from economic sentiment indicators generates advance signals for periods of contraction and expansion in office rents across all three markets: La Défense, London City, and Frankfurt. The lead times for La Défense and Frankfurt are longer than those for London City and range between three and nine months. The evidence in this paper clearly supports the appeal of sentiment indicators and probit analysis to inform forecasting and risk assessment processes. Originality/value Acknowledging the limitations of structural models and related methodologies and the lack of adequate research on turning‐point prediction in the real estate market, this study forecasts episodes of negative and positive office rent growth applying appropriate techniques and data that lead economic activity, are of monthly frequency, and are not revised historically. The paper raises awareness of a forecasting approach that should complement structural models and judgmental forecasting, given its suitability for short‐term forecasting and for signalling turning points in advance.","2012","[('C52', 'E37'), ('C52', 'R32'), ('C52', 'G14'), ('C52', 'R31'), ('C53', 'E37'), ('C53', 'R32'), ('C53', 'G14'), ('C53', 'R31'), ('C32', 'E37'), ('C32', 'R32'), ('C32', 'G14'), ('C32', 'R31')]","['C32', 'E37', 'G14', 'C52', 'C53', 'R32', 'R31']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.1198830409356725","0.1333333333333333","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['E37', 'R32', 'G14', 'R31']","['C52', 'C53', 'C32']"

Patients and Methods: NHANES III household adult, laboratory and mortality data were merged. Only patients examined in the mobile examination center (MEC) were included in this study. The sampling weight employed was WTPFEX6, SDPPSU6 being used for the probability sampling unit and SDPSTRA6 to designate the strata for the survey analysis. All cause and all cancer mortalities were used as binary outcomes. The effect of health insurance coverage status on all cause and all cancer mortalities were analyzed with potential socioeconomic, behavioral and health status confounders. Results: There were 2398 sample persons included in this study. The mean age was 40 years and the mean (S.E.) follow up was 171.85 (3.12) person months from the MEC examination. For all cause mortality, the odds ratios (significant p-values) of the covariates were: age, 1.0095 (0.000); no health insurance coverage (using subjects with health insurance), 1.71 (0.092); black race (using non-Hispanic white subjects as the reference group) 1.43, (0.083); Mexican-Americans, 0.60 (0.089); DMPPIR, 0.82, (0.000); and drinking hard liquor, 1.014 (0.007). For all cancer mortality, the odds ratio (significant p-values) of the covariates were: age, 1.0072 (0.00); no health insurance coverage, using with health coverage as the reference group, 2.91 (0.002); black race, using non-Hispanic whites as the reference group, 1.64 (0.047); Mexican Americans, 0.33 (0.008) and smoking, 1.017 (0.118).

However, little if any attention has been devoted to the construction of a jump-free estimator for integrated covariance that overlooks the well-documented manifestation of joint jumps. Joint jumps are contemporaneous within the day. Therefore, this study proposes a three-point approach that not only deals with estimating volatility, but also constructs a singular-jump-free and joint-jump-free covariance. Since the basic idea of the three-point covariance is based on conditional quantiles, we also provide two alternative procedures for finding approximated estimations in practical applications. Based on this approach, our empirical results confirm that singular jumps and joint jumps occur on the Taiwan Futures Exchange.","2013","[('C14', 'G15'), ('C14', 'G17'), ('C32', 'G15'), ('C32', 'G17'), ('C22', 'G15'), ('C22', 'G17'), ('C13', 'G15'), ('C13', 'G17'), ('C51', 'G15'), ('C51', 'G17')]","['C14', 'G15', 'G17', 'C32', 'C22', 'C13', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","['G15', 'G17']","['C14', 'C32', 'C22', 'C13', 'C51']"

While certain segments of the impact investing industry see strong returns and high positive impact as conflicting objectives, others argue that strong performance across both objectives can be simultaneously achieved. Despite the importance of this question to the industry, no widely accepted framework exists that enables impact investors to determine whether and how they will be able to invest without a trade-off.

This is despite the presence of local currency pricing and due, in large part, to observed exchange rate disconnect in these economies. Optimal policies that account for the uncertainty of model estimates, as captured by the parameters' posterior distribution, similarly exhibit a lack of exchange rate response.

This article is dedicated to the analysis and evaluation of key factors affecting the formation of the Armenian national currency (dram) exchange rate, as well as to the choice of the currency regulation policy in Armenia. The authors carried out a statistical and econometric analysis of the factors of the foreign exchange rate formation, taking into account the specifcs of the transition economy as a whole, as well as the features of the Armenian economy, in particular. The authors have identifed the exogenous and endogenous factors of the foreign exchange rate formation of the dram, depending on the inﬂow and outﬂow of foreign currency. Further, the authors specifed the inﬂuence of dominant factors on the choice of the currency regulation policy in the country. The authors carried out an econometric analysis of the factors identifed at the frst stage of the study using the VAR model. The results obtained from this model proved the hypothesis of the non-market nature of the dram’s exchange rate formation. The authors concluded that the dram’s exchange rate formation has non-market nature because of signifcant intervention on the currency market by the “monetary authorities”. The key conclusion of this study is the thesis about the need to change the approaches to currency regulation in Armenia in favour of the transition to a free-ﬂoating exchange rate policy in order to stimulate sustainable rates of economic growth in the long term.","2018","[('C32', 'E40'), ('C32', 'F41'), ('C32', 'E52'), ('C32', 'O24'), ('C32', 'F31'), ('C51', 'E40'), ('C51', 'F41'), ('C51', 'E52'), ('C51', 'O24'), ('C51', 'F31')]","['C51', 'E40', 'C32', 'F41', 'E52', 'O24', 'F31']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['E40', 'F41', 'E52', 'O24', 'F31']","['C32', 'C51']"

While the validity of the MDS-HSI has been examined in cross-sectional settings, the longitudinal validity has not been explored. The objective of this study was to investigate the longitudinal construct validity of the MDS-HSI in a home care population. This study utilized a retrospective cohort of home care patients in the Hamilton-Niagara-Haldimand-Brant health region of Ontario, Canada with at least two RAI-MDS Home Care assessments between January 2010 and December 2014. Convergent validity was assessed by calculating Spearman rank correlations between the change in MDS-HSI and changes in six validated indices of health domains that can be calculated from the RAI-MDS assessment. Known-groups validity was investigated by fitting multivariable linear regression models to estimate the mean change in MDS-HSI associated with clinically important changes in the six health domain indices and 15 disease symptoms from the RAI-MDS Home Care assessment, controlling for age and sex. The cohort contained 25,182 patients with two RAI-MDS Home Care assessments. Spearman correlations between the MDS-HSI change and changes in the health domain indices were all statistically significant and in the hypothesized small to moderate range [0.1 < ρ < 0.5]. Clinically important changes in all of the health domain indices and 13 of the 15 disease symptoms were significantly associated with clinically important changes in the MDS-HSI. The findings of this study support the longitudinal construct validity of the MDS-HSI in home care populations. In addition to evaluating changes in HRQOL among home care patients in clinical research, economic evaluation, and health technology assessment, the MDS-HSI may be used in system-level applications using routinely collected population-level data.","2018","[('C31', 'I14'), ('C31', 'H51'), ('C31', 'I12'), ('C31', 'I18'), ('C93', 'I14'), ('C93', 'H51'), ('C93', 'I12'), ('C93', 'I18'), ('C10', 'I14'), ('C10', 'H51'), ('C10', 'I12'), ('C10', 'I18')]","['C93', 'I14', 'I12', 'I18', 'C31', 'H51', 'C10']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0059523809523809","0.0","0.0666666666666666","","","['I14', 'H51', 'I12', 'I18']","['C31', 'C93', 'C10']"

This paper presents a wide range of fact findings regarding Asian Olympic performances, including the performances of three outstanding Northeast Asian countries, China, Japan and Korea; the better performances of Asian women than men; and the better performances in weight-stratified contests, such as wrestling, judo, taekwondo, and weightlifting, and in size-free games, such as table tennis, shooting, badminton, archery, and gymnastics. I broadly agree with what Noland and Stahler discover and their forecasts for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games. As is often argued with positive economics, the proof of a good theory depends on its forecasting (predictive) power. We need to wait to see whether Noland and Stahler's approach will still be justifiable after the 2016 Olympics. At this stage, we can say that medal forecasting would be quite accurate for three major countries – China, Japan, and Korea – while those for the rest of Asian countries would contain substantial errors. I will give some reasons in the following. I have two broad questions concerning with this paper at this moment. First, Noland and Stahler rely on Bernard and Busse (2004), Johnson and Ali (2004), and Otamendi and Doncel (2014) for their theoretical framework and econometric estimation methods. Their empirical approach is used extensively in this research field. These authors use the production function approach to the Olympic caliber athletes by assuming that (i) the expected medal share accruing to a country should be equal to its share of the total population of countries participating in the Olympics, and that (ii) the production function for generating Olympic caliber athletes for a country i in year t requires people, money, and some organizational ability. In other words, the authors assume that talent is distributed equally across countries, and the production technology is basically the same across countries except for constant terms (including dummies for regions, the host country, and the communist block dummy). As the actual Olympic records show, many individual sports require physiological advantages, so that competition itself may not be fair from the Asian point of view. This reflects the fact that talent is not distributed equally across countries. Production technology of caliber athletes is also quite different among countries due to various sociocultural differences. In addition, as we know from the industrial organization literature, market share competition depends on the marginal cost of firm i, the response that firm i expects from all other firms per unit change in its own output, and the price elasticity of firm's demand. If we use the analogy of this literature, the medal share must depend not only on own population, per capita gross domestic product, the average years of schooling, gender labor ratio, foreign-born population, but also on other country's efforts to obtain medals in the Olympics, its fiscal cost, society's elasticity of medal demand, and a market competition structure (e.g. Herfindahl–Hirschman Index for country's medal shares). At least, Noland and Stahler should pay some attentions to competition among other countries, since sport is a game after all. Second, the econometric approach Noland and Stahler use is known to face two well-known problems called the incidental parameters problem and the initial conditions problem. The case in point is evident from Noland and Stahler's (2016) figure 3. Medal forecasting for three major Asian countries would be quite accurate in the upper panel of figure3, while those of other Asian countries would be very unpredictable in the lower panel of figure 3. In short, the initial conditions and fixed effects (including dummy variables) create estimation biases in the parameter of interest in the case of dynamic non-linear panel data model (see Greene, 2004 and Wooldridge, 2005). There is no convincing solution to these problems. We know that it is better to trim some heterogeneous data and keep the dataset as homogeneous as possible. I suggest that Noland and Stahler divide the sample according to regions/communist block or religious groups and compare parameters of interest. If parameters differ in the different samples, there exist incidental parameters and/or initial conditions problems. This solution creates another problem because the athletes, indeed, compete with each other with quite heterogeneous backgrounds. The trimming method reduces the sample size substantially.","2016","[('C30', 'J40'), ('C30', 'L10'), ('C30', 'O40'), ('C30', 'Z20'), ('C50', 'J40'), ('C50', 'L10'), ('C50', 'O40'), ('C50', 'Z20'), ('C10', 'J40'), ('C10', 'L10'), ('C10', 'O40'), ('C10', 'Z20')]","['Z20', 'L10', 'C50', 'O40', 'C30', 'C10', 'J40']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['J40', 'L10', 'O40', 'Z20']","['C30', 'C50', 'C10']"

This study measures the status and trends of reimbursement levels of the China Health Insurance System, as well as to offer policy advice to subsequent insurance reforms. Methods The National Reimbursement Ratio was created to determine the reimbursement level of the national health insurance system based on total health expenditure and the covered population. Chinese total health expenditure data from 2004 to 2011 were extracted from China's Health Statistics according to the standards of the International Classification for Health Accounts by Healthcare Financing. Results In 2011, the medical expenditure per capita in China was USD 130.95 and the National Reimbursement Ratio was 26.39%. The National Reimbursement Ratio showed an intense transition from 2004 to 2011, with a sharp decrease from 98.51% in 2004 to 22.44% in 2009, and then a small increase to 26.39% in 2011. Conclusion The National Reimbursement Ratio was effective in revealing the reimbursement level of the national health insurance system and in predicting its trends. The challenge to China's healthcare reform is to switch from increasing insurance coverage to guaranteeing a steady increase in government input and building a powerful supervision mechanism.","2015","[('C43', 'I10'), ('C43', 'H12'), ('C43', 'O53'), ('C43', 'H51'), ('C43', 'I13'), ('C10', 'I10'), ('C10', 'H12'), ('C10', 'O53'), ('C10', 'H51'), ('C10', 'I13')]","['I10', 'H12', 'O53', 'H51', 'C10', 'C43', 'I13']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.02","0.0","0.0","0.3124999999999999","0.3124999999999999","['I10', 'H12', 'O53', 'H51', 'I13']","['C43', 'C10']"

We develop a methodology for decomposing the trend in mortgage performance into a part due to economic conditions and a part due to underwriting changes, and provide natural metrics or indices of underwriting quality and economic conditions. The recent mortgage debacle can be attributed about equally to each factor. Important underwriting characteristics were eased in the 1990s, but the negative effects of lower standards were masked by strong local and national economic conditions. After 2002, there was little change in observable loan characteristics, but loan performance still eroded, even after controlling for the economic environment. Our evidence suggests that erosion after 2002 must have arisen from underwriting covariates that are unobservable to investors, consistent with the hypothesis that moral hazard in ""nonagency"" securitizations caused underwriting risks to be mispriced.","2011","[('C53', 'E32'), ('C53', 'G21'), ('C53', 'G28'), ('C53', 'G01'), ('C53', 'R31'), ('C18', 'E32'), ('C18', 'G21'), ('C18', 'G28'), ('C18', 'G01'), ('C18', 'R31')]","['E32', 'G21', 'G28', 'C53', 'G01', 'C18', 'R31']","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","0.0","0.0","","","['E32', 'G21', 'G28', 'G01', 'R31']","['C53', 'C18']"

In this paper we generalize these results to a multidimensional Black-Scholes market. In such a market, we discuss optimal contracts for investors who prefer more to less and have a fixed investment horizon T > 0. First, given a desired probability distribution, we give an explicit form of the optimal contract that provides this distribution to the consumer. Second, in the case of risk-averse investors, we are able to propose two ways of improving the design of financial products. In all cases, the optimal payoff can be seen as a path-independent European option that is written on the so-called market portfolio. We illustrate the theory with a few well-known securities and strategies. For example, we show that a buy-and-hold investment strategy can be dominated by a series of power options written on the underlying market portfolio. We also analyze the inefficiency of a widely used portfolio insurance strategy called Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance.","2011","[('C53', 'G13'), ('C53', 'G11'), ('C53', 'G12'), ('C53', 'D81'), ('C61', 'G13'), ('C61', 'G11'), ('C61', 'G12'), ('C61', 'D81'), ('C02', 'G13'), ('C02', 'G11'), ('C02', 'G12'), ('C02', 'D81')]","['C61', 'G11', 'G12', 'G13', 'C53', 'C02', 'D81']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.1401376401376401","0.1672008547008547","0.119047619047619","0.1458333333333333","0.0","0.0","['G13', 'G11', 'G12', 'D81']","['C53', 'C61', 'C02']"

One characteristic of insider trading in Hong Kong is the high frequency of transactions and the large amounts of money involved. Inside purchases appear to signal and correct undervaluation and inside sales appear to signal and correct overvaluation. In contrast to research from Britain and the United States, insider sales are more informative than purchases. On average, insiders earn HK$91,297 per trade, while outsiders who mimic insiders' transactions earn minimal returns. Many firms suffer from infrequent trading and our results are consistent with directors engaging in inside transactions so as to help create a market for the shares. In additional tests, we find that the frequency of insider trading is a function of information asymmetry.","2011","[('C22', 'G30'), ('C22', 'K22'), ('C22', 'G10'), ('C22', 'G14'), ('C12', 'G30'), ('C12', 'K22'), ('C12', 'G10'), ('C12', 'G14'), ('C51', 'G30'), ('C51', 'K22'), ('C51', 'G10'), ('C51', 'G14')]","['G10', 'G14', 'C22', 'G30', 'C12', 'K22', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.1715542521994135","0.2875","0.0","0.0","","","['G30', 'K22', 'G10', 'G14']","['C22', 'C12', 'C51']"

Because only short-term acute care hospitals were eligible for the act's meaningful-use incentive program, we used national hospital data to examine the differential effect of HITECH on EHR adoption among eligible and ineligible hospitals in the periods before (2008-10) and after (2011-15) implementation of the program. We found that annual increases in EHR adoption rates among eligible hospitals went from 3.2 percent in the pre period to 14.2 percent in the post period. Ineligible hospitals experienced much smaller annual increases of 0.1 percent in the pre period and 3.3 percent in the post period, a significant difference-in-differences of 7.9 percentage points.

The insurer is allowed to purchase combining quota-share and excess of loss reinsurance for claims and to invest in financial market to increase his wealth. The financial market consists of a risk-free asset and a risky asset whose price process follows a jump-diffusion process. The insurer wants to find an optimal time-consistent reinsurance-investment strategy so as to maximize the expected terminal surplus while minimizing the variance of the terminal surplus. By using the stochastic control technique, we obtain the explicit solutions for the optimal reinsurance-investment strategy and the corresponding optimal value function. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to illustrate the effects of model parameters on the optimal time-consistent reinsurance-investment strategy, and to compare the pure excess of loss reinsurance with the pure quota-share reinsurance through analyzing the optimal value function.","2019","[('C15', 'G13'), ('C15', 'G11'), ('C15', 'G22'), ('C15', 'D81'), ('C61', 'G13'), ('C61', 'G11'), ('C61', 'G22'), ('C61', 'D81'), ('C02', 'G13'), ('C02', 'G11'), ('C02', 'G22'), ('C02', 'D81')]","['C61', 'G11', 'G22', 'G13', 'C15', 'C02', 'D81']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['G13', 'G11', 'G22', 'D81']","['C15', 'C61', 'C02']"

Thirty-one states and the District of Columbia have expanded eligibility for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Millions of low-income adults have gained health care coverage and, in states offering dental benefits, oral health coverage as well. Using data for 2010 and 2014 from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we examined the impact of Medicaid adult dental coverage and eligibility expansions on low-income adults' use of dental care. We found that low-income adults in states that provided dental benefits beyond emergency-only coverage were more likely to have had a dental visit in the past year, compared to low-income adults in states without such benefits. Among states that provided dental benefits and expanded their Medicaid program, regression-based estimates suggest that childless adults had a significant increase (1.8 percentage points) in the likelihood of having had a dental visit, while parents had a significant decline (8.1 percentage points). One possible explanation for the disparity is that after expansion, newly enrolled childless adults might have exhausted the limited dental provider capacity that was available to parents before expansion. Additional policy-level efforts may be needed to expand the dental care delivery system's capacity.","2017","[('C93', 'J18'), ('C93', 'H75'), ('C93', 'I11'), ('C93', 'H51'), ('C93', 'I13'), ('C21', 'J18'), ('C21', 'H75'), ('C21', 'I11'), ('C21', 'H51'), ('C21', 'I13')]","['J18', 'C93', 'H75', 'I11', 'H51', 'C21', 'I13']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0575311942959001","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['J18', 'H75', 'I11', 'H51', 'I13']","['C93', 'C21']"

Some researchers believe that education improves a worker's productivity (or human capital), making them more desirable on the job market, while others believe that it improves a worker's network (or social capital), giving them more information about lucrative openings and more resources to secure a job (such as references from peers). Much of the research on human and social capital focuses on quantifying the various impacts of schooling on workers and often overlooks how economic systems actually manage to produce those outcomes. This paper develops an agent-based complex adaptive system featuring formal schooling and on-the-job training, social networks, labour market search and durable employment contracts to explain the process linking education to labour market outcomes and economic performance in New Zealand (and similar economies).

The results of modified Granger Causality test suggest that expanded public investment in infrastructure has not played an important role in stimulating private investment in industry. If anything, it appears that private investment has stimulated a follow-on expansion in infrastructure. Instead of crowding in (i.e., a positive feedback effect) additional private investment, infrastructure investment appears to have led to larger deficits and domestic borrowing. In tum, these financial developments have dampened the flows of private capital into the important large-scale manufacturing sector. On the other hand, financial crowding-out of private investment in large-scale manufacturing is a distinct possibility; but it may not be a simple, straight-forward process. The results obtained also suggest that private investment in large-scale manufacturing has suffered from real crowding-out associated with the government's noninfrastructural investment programme. Finally, it should be noted that neither financial nor real crowding-out seems to occur in other areas of private investment. Clearly, further research should be undertaken to determine why the large-scale manufacturing sector is unique in this regard.","2018","[('C32', 'H54'), ('C32', 'O16'), ('C32', 'E62'), ('C32', 'E44'), ('C32', 'E22'), ('C51', 'H54'), ('C51', 'O16'), ('C51', 'E62'), ('C51', 'E44'), ('C51', 'E22')]","['H54', 'O16', 'C32', 'E62', 'E44', 'E22', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['H54', 'O16', 'E62', 'E44', 'E22']","['C32', 'C51']"

The unevenness of the level of development in the regions in the Republic of Serbia is one of the most complex development problems. The current economic policy has caused that the gap between rich and poor regions is increasing in Serbia. Different demographic development of the regions is consequences of differences of economic development. In this paper, the authors analyze the quantitative and qualitative population's characteristics. Attention is given to the implementation of VIKOR methods in order to rank the regions of Serbia according to the level of demographic development. Ranking regions by multiple criteria simultaneously, contributes to the determination of the real situation in terms of regional differences. The authors demonstrate that the multi-criteria analysis could be applied to determine the demographic disparities between the levels of development of the regions. The criteria and their importance could be changed depending on the consideration of demographic, economic and social development. Also, other methods of multi-criteria analysis in the evaluation of the demographic development of the region or state is applied.","2017","[('C44', 'J11'), ('C44', 'R11'), ('C44', 'O18'), ('C44', 'R12'), ('C44', 'R58'), ('C61', 'J11'), ('C61', 'R11'), ('C61', 'O18'), ('C61', 'R12'), ('C61', 'R58')]","['J11', 'C61', 'R11', 'C44', 'O18', 'R12', 'R58']","False","False","False","False","False","True","0.0","0.2333333333333333","0.0","0.0","1.0","","['J11', 'R11', 'O18', 'R12', 'R58']","['C44', 'C61']"

Ramsey made two major contributions to economics, both published in the Economic Journal in 1927 and 1928, which became popular only in the 1950s and 1960s. In both cases, economists portrayed Ramsey as a sleeping giant: a mathematician who had almost no impact on the economics profession prior to 1950 because his mathematical analysis was out of the reach of the typical economist of his time. My goal in this article is to understand how Ramsey's growth model became part of the neoclassical literature on economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s and how Ramsey became a sacred predecessor of this field. In order to better understand the stabilization of Ramsey's growth model in postwar economics, I conduct a JSTOR search and consult a few book references. Based on this dataset, I conclude that Ramsey was in fact “awake” in the economic growth literature pre-1950. I discuss as well the main economists who transported Ramsey from the Cambridge milieu of the 1920s to the North American economics of the postwar period.","2009","[('B31', 'A11'), ('B31', 'B20'), ('B31', 'N10'), ('B31', 'O40'), ('B31', 'B23'), ('C60', 'A11'), ('C60', 'B20'), ('C60', 'N10'), ('C60', 'O40'), ('C60', 'B23')]","['C60', 'A11', 'B20', 'N10', 'O40', 'B23', 'B31']","True","True","True","True","True","True","","","0.0","0.0","0.6666666666666666","0.5","['A11', 'B20', 'N10', 'O40', 'B23']","['B31', 'C60']"
"https://openalex.org/W1998517579","https://doi.org/10.1080/1350178x.2010.525040","Implications for models in monetary policy"," Monetary authorities have been implicated in the financial crisis of 2007–2008. John Muellbauer, for example, has blamed what he thought was initially inadequate policy responses by central banks to the crisis on their models, which are, in his words, 'overdue for the scrap heap'. This paper investigates the role of monetary policy models in the crisis and finds that (i) it is likely that monetary policy contributed to the financial crisis; and (ii) that an inappropriately narrow suite of models made this mistake easier. The core models currently used at prominent central banks were not designed to discover emergent financial fragility. In that respect John Muellbauer is right. But the implications drawn here are less dramatic than his: while the representative agent approach to micro-foundations now seems indefensible, other aspects of modern macroeconomics are not similarly suspect. The case made here is rather for expanding the suite of models used in the regular deliberations of monetary authorities, with new models that give explicit roles to the financial sector, to money and to the process of exchange. Recommending a suite of models for policy making entails no methodological innovation. That is what central banks do; though, of course, how they do it is open to improvement. The methodological innovation is the inclusion of a model that would be sensitive to financial fragility, a sensitivity that was absent in the run-up to the current financial crisis. Keywords: monetary policyfinancial crisismethodology of policy modelsJEL Codes:: B400E130E440E520 Notes 1. There are a number of excellent accounts of the crisis, such as Blanchard (2009 Blanchard, O.J. (2009), 'The Crisis: Basic Mechanisms, and Appropriate Policies', IMF Working Paper WP/09/80, Washington, DC [Google Scholar]) and Almunia et al. (2009) and recently Roberts (2010 Roberts, R. (2010), 'Gambling With Other People's Money: How Perverted Incentives Caused the Financial Crisis', Research Paper, Mercatus Centre at George Mason University, Arlington, VA [Google Scholar]) with a focus on the changes in financial sector incentives. The text focuses on those aspects most closely related to monetary policy and, consequently, misses a lot of the detail (especially of an institutional kind) in these broader accounts. 2. This was one of the less widely shared notions in the modern consensus on monetary policy. Or to be more precise it was one of the elements of the consensus which many monetary economists and central bankers felt was more open to further research and experience (Goodfriend 2005 Goodfriend, M. (2005), 'The Monetary Policy Debate Since October 1979: Lessons for Theory and Practice', Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis Economic Review, 87 (2, part 2) 243–261 [Google Scholar]; Mishkin 2007 Mishkin, F.S. 2007. Monetary Policy Strategy, The MIT Press: Cambridge, MA. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]). 3. Note that Bernanke and Gertler (1999 Bernanke, B. and Gertler, M. 1999. Monetary Policy and Asset Price Volatility. Economic Review, Q(V), 17–51 [Google Scholar]) did not recommend policy paralysis; on the contrary they reasoned that 'asset price crashes have done sustained damage to the economy only in cases when monetary policy remained unresponsive or actively reinforced deflationary pressures' (Bernanke and Gertler 1999 Bernanke, B. and Gertler, M. 1999. Monetary Policy and Asset Price Volatility. Economic Review, Q(V), 17–51 [Google Scholar], p. 18). And it seemed that the required response was precisely the response indicated by a flexible inflation targeting system. 4. While 'monetary policy' typically means the interest rate policy of a modern central bank, there are other instruments available to central banks, including reserve requirements, quantitative adjustments to the monetary base and usually a role in the regulation of financial sector firms (Borio and Disyatat 2009 Borio, C., and Disyatat, P. (2009), 'Unconventional Monetary Policies: An Appraisal', BIC Working Paper No. 292, Basel [Google Scholar]). 5. Blinder (2005 Blinder, A.S. (2005), 'Understanding the Greenspan Standard', Paper presented at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansan City Symposium on The Greenspan Era: Lessons for the Future, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, 25–27 August [Google Scholar]) argued that the 'mop up' approach passed a 'severe' stress test with the unwinding of the dot.com bubble from 2000 to 2002. 6. For Mishkin (2008 MishkinF.S. (2008), 'How Should We Respond to Asset Price Bubbles?', Speech at the Wharton Financial Institutions Center and Oliver Wyman Institute's Annual Financial Risk Roundtable, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 15 May [Google Scholar]) a prerequisite for taking policy action against even a credit bubble is that the bubble reflects market failure of some kind. 7. William Poole – then chief executive of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis – observed the same in 2007 (Poole 2007 Poole, W. (2007), 'Understanding the Fed', Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis Economic Review, 89(1), 3–13 [Google Scholar]). 8. The awareness of the data constraints under which policy is made in real time is hardly new, and the point has been made repeatedly in the post-War period, by, to name just a few: Friedman (1947 Friedman, M. 1947. Lerner on the Economics of Control. Journal of Political Economy, 55(5): 405–416. [Google Scholar]), Meltzer (1987 Meltzer, A.H. 1987. Limits of Short-Run Stabilization Policy. Economic Inquiry, 25: 1–14. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]) and McCallum (1994 McCallum, B.T. 1994. Specification of Policy Rules and Performance Measures in Multicountry Stimulation Studies. Journal of International Money and Finance, 13(3): 259–275. [Google Scholar]) and more recently by Orphanides in a series of papers, including Orphanides (2002 Orphanides, A. 2002. Monetary Policy Evaluation with Noisy Information. Journal of Monetary Economics, 50: 605–631. [Google Scholar]). Two important lessons have emerged from this literature (Orphanides 2002 Orphanides, A. 2002. Monetary Policy Evaluation with Noisy Information. Journal of Monetary Economics, 50: 605–631. [Google Scholar], p. 606): first, the evaluation of past policy must be sensitive to the data available in real time to the policy makers. For the case at hand this means looking at the Fed's best estimates of output and inflation in the critical years between 2001 and 2005, not an evaluation of what seems optimal with the benefit of the revised data. Second, realistic policy alternatives have to be based on data that is both available and measurable with a high signal-to-noise ratio. From this perspective it is not useful to examine the merit of alternative policy paths in 2001 to 2005 based on the assumption that policy makers could have known that an asset bubble was emerging in the US housing market. The quantitative importance of noise in the data on the merit of alternative policy paths was demonstrated through simulation by Orphanides (2002 Orphanides, A. 2002. Monetary Policy Evaluation with Noisy Information. Journal of Monetary Economics, 50: 605–631. [Google Scholar]). He contrasts the substantial gains that appear within the grasp of an activist monetary authority when they operate with noiseless data, with the substantially inferior results generated by the same activism when the relevant data is noisy. Indeed with noise a much less activist policy rule delivers substantially better stabilisation for the economy. The same result, favouring a 'conservative' central banker, emerges when the monetary authorities grapple not only with noisy data but with uncertainty about the transmission mechanism and expectations (Orphanides and Williams 2008 Orphanides, A. and Williams, J.C. 2008. Learning, Expectations Formation, and Pitfalls of Optimal Control Monetary Policy. Journal of Monetary Economics, 55: S80–S86. [Google Scholar]). 9. These 'nowcasts' are released with a five-year time lag, allowing consideration of the critical 2002 to 2005 period at the time of writing. 10. John Muellbauer (2007 Muellbauer, J. (2007), 'Housing, Credit and Consumer Expenditure', Paper presented at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's 2007 Jackson Hole Symposium on Housing, Housing Finance, Monetary Policy, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, 30 August–1 September [Google Scholar]) argued that the Fed's concern with the risk of deflation was a misplaced fear that the Japanese episode of the 1990s could be repeated in the USA. 11. There were many other factors such as regulatory mistakes or even 'holes' in financial regulation as well as psychological factors such as overoptimism that played a role in the increased leverage and perverse incentives that encouraged risk taking in the banking sector (Blanchard 2009 Blanchard, O.J. (2009), 'The Crisis: Basic Mechanisms, and Appropriate Policies', IMF Working Paper WP/09/80, Washington, DC [Google Scholar]; Roberts 2010 Roberts, R. (2010), 'Gambling With Other People's Money: How Perverted Incentives Caused the Financial Crisis', Research Paper, Mercatus Centre at George Mason University, Arlington, VA [Google Scholar]). 12. Models used by central banks in the policy process will usually disaggregate this IS relationship in a number of constituent relationships by different types of real expenditure (Goodhart 2005 Goodhart, C.A.E. (2005), 'The Future of Central Banking', LSE Financial Markets Group Special Paper No. 62, London [Google Scholar], pp. 3–4). 13. As Sims (2002 Sims, C.A. 2002. The Role of Models and Probabilities in the Monetary Policy Process. Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, 2: 1–40. [Crossref] , [Google Scholar]) showed, the policy process at leading central banks uses model results combined with non-model information about the economy, from surveys and other data, as well as subjective judgments. 14. While they specify a continuum of households their aggregation is trivial due to the assumptions of separable utility and complete contingent markets (Fernández-Villaverde et al. 2010 Fernández-Villaverde, J., Guerrón-Quintana, P.A., and Rubio-Ramírez, J.F. (2010), 'Reading the Recent Monetary History of the US, 1959–2007', NBER Working Paper 15929, Cambridge, MA [Google Scholar], p. 6). 15. That is to say without 'sound justification' (Fernández-Villaverde et al. 2010 Fernández-Villaverde, J., Guerrón-Quintana, P.A., and Rubio-Ramírez, J.F. (2010), 'Reading the Recent Monetary History of the US, 1959–2007', NBER Working Paper 15929, Cambridge, MA [Google Scholar], p. 5). 16. Identifying the key institutions (those where stress and failure will have consequences beyond the 'limited group of customers and counterparties' (Crockett 1997 Crockett, A. (1997), 'Why Is Financial Stability a Goal of Public Policy?', Paper presented at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City's 1997 Jackson Hole Symposium on Maintaining Financial Stability in a Global Economy, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, 28–30 August [Google Scholar], p. 10) is difficult in practice. The recent crisis suggests that well-informed central banks can err in this judgement. Nevertheless, reforms under consideration for financial regulation internationally emphasise the position of 'systemically important institutions'. 17. Important papers in this literature include: Tsomocos (2003a Tsomocos, D.P. 2003a. Equilibrium Analysis, Banking and Financial Instability. Journal of Mathematical Economics, 39: 619–655. [Google Scholar]; 2003b TsomocosD.P. (2003b), 'Equilibrium Analysis, Banking, Contagion and Financial Fragility', Bank of England Working Paper No. 175, London [Google Scholar]) and Goodhart et al. (2004 Goodhart, C.A.E., Sunirand, P. and Tsomocos, D. 2004. A Model to Analyse Financial Fragility: Applications. Journal of Financial Stability, 1: 1–30. [Google Scholar], 2006 Goodhart, C.A.E., Sunirand, P. and Tsomocos, D. 2006. A Model to Analyse Financial Fragility. Economic Theory, 27: 107–142. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]). 18. This discussion draws on Bårdsen et al. (2006, pp. 9–13), but the criteria envisioned for an adequate model here differ notably from his list. 19. Heterogeneity in the banking sector is critical for a model of financial fragility: in a representative agent model either all banks (the bank) will fail, or not, while the feature of financial fragility that is of interest here is the failure of some banks, while others survive, perhaps in a more fragile condition. Further there is no possibility of an inter-bank market (the source of much contagious interaction between banks and prominent in this regard in the present crisis) without heterogeneous banks (Goodhart et al. 2006 Goodhart, C.A.E., Sunirand, P. and Tsomocos, D. 2006. A Model to Analyse Financial Fragility. Economic Theory, 27: 107–142. [Crossref], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]). Some DSGE models have incorporated financial friction by way of a financial accelerator, in which a representative agent model with asymmetric information generates balance sheet effects for the firm through one-period stochastic optimal debt-contracts with costly verification. Though this is a successful strategy to include balance sheet effects, it does not create any role for banks in the model, nor is there any room for regulatory policies in a framework where the equilibrium is always constrained efficient (Goodhart et al. 2010 Goodhart, C.A.E., Osorio, C. and Tsomocos, D. 2010. ""The Optimal Monetary Policy Instrument, Inflation Versus Asset Price Targeting, and Financial Stability"". In Inflation Targeting Twenty Years On, Edited by: Cobham, D., Eitrheim, Ø., Gerlach, S. and Qvigstad, J.F. 192–231. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. [Google Scholar], p. 2). 20. Goodhart et al. (e.g. 2006 Goodhart, C.A.E., Sunirand, P. and Tsomocos, D. 2004. A Model to Analyse Financial Fragility: Applications. Journal of Financial Stability, 1: 1–30. [Google Scholar] and 2004 Hoover, K.D. 2009. ""Microfoundations and the Ontology of Macroeconomics"". In The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Economics, Edited by: Kincaid, H. and Ross, D. 386–409. Oxford: Oxford University Press. [Google Scholar]) build on earlier work in this direction by Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik (2000 Dubey, P., Geanakopolis, J., and Shubik, M. (2000), 'Default in a General Equilibrium Model With Incomplete Markets', Cowles Foundation Discussion Paper No. 1247, New Haven [Google Scholar]) and Shubik and Wilson (1977 Shubik, M. and Wilson, C. 1977. The Optimal Bankruptcy Rule in a Trading Economy Using Fiat Money. Journal of Economics, 37: 337–354. [Google Scholar]). 21. The RAMSI model under development at the Bank of England (discussed below) is an example of the microeconomic foundations envisioned here. 22. Hoover (2010 HooverK.D. (2010), 'Microfoundations Programs', Paper prepared for the First International Symposium on the History of Economic Thought, The Integration of Micro and Macroeconomics From a Historical Perspective, University of Sāo Paulo, Brazil, 3–5 August [Google Scholar]) identified three distinct programmes to develop micro-foundations for macroeconomic models, which he called (i) the aggregation programme; (ii) the general-equilibrium programme; and (iii) the representative-agent programme. The micro-foundations described above are closer to the heterogeneity that Hoover identified in Keynes and the aggregation programme of Klein. By contrast, the micro-foundations used almost universally in modern macroeconomics are of the representative agent kind, on the shortcomings of which see Hoover (2008 Hoover, K.D. (2008), 'Idealizing Reduction: The Microfoundations of Macroeconomics', Mimeograph, Duke University, Durham, NC [Google Scholar], 2009 Hoover, K.D. 2009. ""Microfoundations and the Ontology of Macroeconomics"". In The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Economics, Edited by: Kincaid, H. and Ross, D. 386–409. Oxford: Oxford University Press. [Google Scholar] and 2010 HooverK.D. (2010), 'Microfoundations Programs', Paper prepared for the First International Symposium on the History of Economic Thought, The Integration of Micro and Macroeconomics From a Historical Perspective, University of Sāo Paulo, Brazil, 3–5 August [Google Scholar]). The tremendous problems of aggregation and the problems of working with the utility function of a representative agent as if the connection to the utility functions of individuals is not deeply problematic (and perhaps insurmountable) have never been answered (Hoover 2010 HooverK.D. (2010), 'Microfoundations Programs', Paper prepared for the First International Symposium on the History of Economic Thought, The Integration of Micro and Macroeconomics From a Historical Perspective, University of Sāo Paulo, Brazil, 3–5 August [Google Scholar]). Under these circumstances the widespread adoption of representative agent models has the character of an ideological response (Hoover 2009 Hoover, K.D. 2009. ""Microfoundations and the Ontology of Macroeconomics"". In The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy and Economics, Edited by: Kincaid, H. and Ross, D. 386–409. Oxford: Oxford University Press. [Google Scholar]). 23. There are many reasons for this, including the belief by policy committee members that the additional information gives them a more accurate picture of the current state of the economy and hence a superior basis for their short-term forecasts of key variables; in Sims's words, 'several of those involved in subjective forecasting, at more than one central bank, expressed the view that the advantage of subjective forecasts is almost entirely in getting the current and the next quarter right' (Sims 2006 Sims, C.A. 2006. ""Comments on Blinder's ""The Case Against the Case Against Discretionary Fiscal Policy"". In The Macroeconomics of Fiscal Policy, Edited by: Kopcke, R.W., Tootell, G.M.B. and Triest, R.K. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press. [Google Scholar], p. 21). The desire to respond to large and unusual events is another reason for the persistent use of the non-model information. A third reason is the belief that no single model captures the range of issues relevant to a MPC (Vickers 1999 Vickers, J. (1999), 'Economic Models and Monetary Policy', Speech to the Governors of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, London, 18 May [Google Scholar]).","2010","[('B41', 'E13'), ('B41', 'E52'), ('B41', 'E44'), ('B41', 'E58'), ('B41', 'G01'), ('C51', 'E13'), ('C51', 'E52'), ('C51', 'E44'), ('C51', 'E58'), ('C51', 'G01')]","['B41', 'E13', 'E52', 'E44', 'E58', 'G01', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.2916666666666666","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.5","0.6666666666666666","['E13', 'E52', 'E44', 'E58', 'G01']","['B41', 'C51']"

We introduce and study two important special cases of the bribery problem, namely, FRUGAL-BRIBERY and FRUGAL-$BRIBERY where the briber is frugal in nature. By this, we mean that the briber is only able to influence voters who benefit from the suggestion of the briber. More formally, a voter is vulnerable if the outcome of the election improves according to her own preference when she accepts the suggestion of the briber. In the FRUGAL-BRIBERY problem, the goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by changing only the vulnerable votes. In the FRUGAL-$BRIBERY problem, the vulnerable votes have prices and the goal is to make a certain candidate win the election by changing only the vulnerable votes, subject to a budget constraint. We show that both the FRUGAL-BRIBERY and the FRUGAL-$BRIBERY problems are intractable for many commonly used voting rules for weighted as well as unweighted elections. These intractability results demonstrate that bribery is a hard computational problem, in the sense that several special cases of this problem continue to be computationally intractable. This strengthens the view that bribery, although a possible attack on an election in principle, may be infeasible in practice.","2016","[('C44', 'D78'), ('C44', 'P16'), ('C44', 'H41'), ('C44', 'D72'), ('C71', 'D78'), ('C71', 'P16'), ('C71', 'H41'), ('C71', 'D72'), ('C63', 'D78'), ('C63', 'P16'), ('C63', 'H41'), ('C63', 'D72')]","['H41', 'C63', 'D78', 'C44', 'P16', 'C71', 'D72']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.2738095238095238","0.2916666666666666","['D78', 'P16', 'H41', 'D72']","['C44', 'C71', 'C63']"

Design/methodology/approach The MUSI‐SP methodology has the aim to evaluate the satisfaction of the beneficiaries of social programs, as well as its causes (program practices and perceived quality) and results (measured as trust). The MUSI‐SP methodology for this case study covers the design of a specific structural equation model based on the model for government services and nonprofit organizations of the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) and a qualitative study, with the help of the design and pilot testing of the questionnaire for measuring satisfaction in a population with a high grade of marginalization, followed by data collected through a national face‐to‐face survey, then the analysis of validity and dependability of the specific structural equation model and the identification of opportunity areas. Findings The evaluation shows that the variable “Results” derived by having a concrete floor has a larger impact on “Perceived Quality” and it has the best users’ assessment (86 in a scale from 0 to 100). Furthermore, a high and positive relationship from “Perceived Quality” with “Satisfaction,” and “Satisfaction” with “Trust” were confirmed. Practical implications The MUSI‐SP methodology would be an appropriate indicator as a complement to current evaluations of government social programs, because it shows a path to citizen satisfaction and citizen trust. Originality/value The Mexican Concrete Floor Program, illustrated in this paper, aims to increase the quality of life conditions of the citizens through concrete floor installation for housing improvement.","2013","[('C42', 'H51'), ('C42', 'I31'), ('C42', 'O21'), ('C42', 'M31'), ('C19', 'H51'), ('C19', 'I31'), ('C19', 'O21'), ('C19', 'M31'), ('C38', 'H51'), ('C38', 'I31'), ('C38', 'O21'), ('C38', 'M31')]","['I31', 'O21', 'M31', 'C42', 'H51', 'C19', 'C38']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['H51', 'I31', 'O21', 'M31']","['C19', 'C38']"

We use data from an employee survey conducted in 2005 and employ Oaxaca-Blinder-Neumark decomposition. Among Russian and Armenian survey participants, men are more likely to exhibit an internal LOC (attribute success to own actions), and individuals with an internal LOC tend to earn more than individuals who attribute success to fate or other external forces (exhibit an external LOC). In Kazakhstan, gender differences in LOC and the estimated effects of LOC on earnings are small and statistically insignificant. Gender differences in LOC explain 5.5 percent of the gender pay gap in Armenia, 7 percent in Russia, and 2.7 percent in Kazakhstan.

Optimal portfolios with several restrictions were constructed and the results from Australian and US investors were compared. The study also uses a holding out period that is rebalanced at the end of each quarter using new portfolio weights. Findings – The study finds that there are significant benefits for the Australian investor from diversifying into frontier markets. However, the benefits to the US investor are much higher than that of an Australian investor. The results from the holding out period also present significantly higher benefits to the US investor compared to the Australian investor.

In today's most popular mainstream economics textbook, N. Gregory Mankiw outlines the forms, concepts, and methods of “thinking like an economist,” including positive analysis, a focus on efficiency, and a host of assumptions about individual human nature. Comparing the two, we find that the “fetishism of the commodity” parallels the set of conditions described by Mankiw as comprising “thinking like an economist.” However, Mankiw treats these conditions as natural while Marx understands them to be social, historical, and open to change. I argue that numerous possibilities are opened up in economics education by destabilizing the “market fetishism” of mainstream economics and teaching neoclassical theory as a social and historical construction rather than a reflection of economic reality.","2010","[('B40', 'P10'), ('B40', 'A20'), ('A10', 'P10'), ('A10', 'A20'), ('B50', 'P10'), ('B50', 'A20'), ('B30', 'P10'), ('B30', 'A20')]","['A10', 'B50', 'B30', 'B40', 'A20', 'P10']","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","0.0","0.0","","","['P10', 'A20']","['B40', 'A10', 'B50', 'B30']"

We examined the association between observed-to-expected rates and hospital characteristics by using multivariable linear regression.We examined a total of 1 416 716 hospitalizations. The mean AC 30-day readmission rate was 11.3% (range 4.3%-19.6%); the mean PPR rate was 4.9% (range 2.9%-6.9%).

Hospitals with higher volumes, lower percentages of infants, and higher percentage of patients with low income performed worse than expected on PPR.High-volume hospitals, those that serve fewer infants, and those with a high percentage of patients from low-income neighborhoods have higher than expected PPR rates and are at higher risk of reimbursement penalties.","2017","[('C21', 'I10'), ('C21', 'H75'), ('C21', 'I18'), ('C21', 'I11'), ('C21', 'H51'), ('C10', 'I10'), ('C10', 'H75'), ('C10', 'I18'), ('C10', 'I11'), ('C10', 'H51')]","['I10', 'H75', 'I18', 'I11', 'H51', 'C10', 'C21']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0026815377313716","0.0023255813953488","0.0","0.0","","","['I10', 'H75', 'I18', 'I11', 'H51']","['C21', 'C10']"

This can be measured by instances of impoverishment, when a household's consumption including out-of-pocket spending on health is more than the poverty line but its consumption, excluding out-of-pocket spending, is less than the poverty line. This links UHC directly to the policy goal of reducing poverty.We measure the incidence and depth of impoverishment as the difference in the poverty head count and poverty gap with and without out-of-pocket spending included in household total consumption. We use three poverty lines: the US$1·90 per day and $3·10 per day international poverty lines and a relative poverty line of 50% of median consumption per capita. We estimate impoverishment in 122 countries using 516 surveys between 1984 and 2015. We estimate the global incidence of impoverishment due to out-of-pocket payments by aggregating up from each country, using a survey for the year in question when available, and interpolation and model-based estimates otherwise. We do not derive global estimates to measure the depth of impoverishment but focus on the median depth for the 122 countries in our sample, accounting for 90% of the world's population.We find impoverishment due to out-of-pocket spending even in countries where the entire population is officially covered by a health insurance scheme or by national or subnational health services. Incidence is negatively correlated with the share of total health spending channelled through social security funds and other government agencies. Across countries, the population-weighted median annual rate of change of impoverishment is negative at the $1·90 per day poverty line but positive at the $3·10 per day and relative poverty lines. We estimate that at the $1·90 per day poverty line, the worldwide incidence of impoverishment decreased between 2000 and 2010, from 131 million people (2·1% of the world's population) to 97 million people (1·4%). The population-weighted median of the poverty gap increase attributable to out-of-pocket health expenditures among the 122 countries in our sample are ¢1·22 per capita at the $1·90 per day poverty line and ¢3·74 per capita at the $3·10 per day poverty line. In all countries, out-of-pocket spending can be both catastrophic and impoverishing at all income levels, but this partly depends on the choice of the poverty line.Out-of-pocket spending on health can add to the poverty head count and the depth of poverty by diverting household spending from non-health budget items. The scale of such impoverishment varies between countries and depends on the poverty line but might in some low-income countries account for as much as four percentage points of the poverty head count. Increasing the share of total health expenditure that is prepaid, especially through taxes and mandatory contributions, can help reduce impoverishment.Rockefeller Foundation, Ministry of Health of Japan, and UK Department for International Development.","2017","[('C43', 'I32'), ('C43', 'O15'), ('C43', 'I10'), ('C43', 'H12'), ('C43', 'H51'), ('C10', 'I32'), ('C10', 'O15'), ('C10', 'I10'), ('C10', 'H12'), ('C10', 'H51')]","['I32', 'O15', 'I10', 'H12', 'H51', 'C10', 'C43']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['I32', 'O15', 'I10', 'H12', 'H51']","['C43', 'C10']"

This paper represents an attempt to fill this void using a random sample of microfinance institutions in the three northern regions of Ghana -Northern, Upper East and Upper West regions. The impact of financial characteristics on innovation was ascertained using a combination of Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) multiple regression, and binary logistic regression. The findings revealed that the loan repayment rate, and interest rate affect the introduction of new savings products (product innovation), and number of branches (location innovation). Sources of funding involving banking funding, and equity of owner were found to encourage the development of new loan products. The findings call for the need for MFIs to diversify their funding sources as a means of enhancing innovativeness and mitigating risk.","2013","[('C30', 'O16'), ('C30', 'G21'), ('C30', 'M21'), ('C30', 'O31'), ('C30', 'G20'), ('C10', 'O16'), ('C10', 'G21'), ('C10', 'M21'), ('C10', 'O31'), ('C10', 'G20')]","['O16', 'G21', 'M21', 'C10', 'C30', 'O31', 'G20']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['O16', 'G21', 'M21', 'O31', 'G20']","['C30', 'C10']"

This model suggests that the volume of trade between two countries is proportional to the product of their national income and inversely proportional to the distance between them. This study attempts to answer the question whether the gravity model is still valid for the case of Turkey today in the age of globalization and declining transportation costs due to improvements in logistics and technology. To this end, Turkey's imports as well as exports data with respect to all the countries of the world for the 16 years between 1993 and 2008 are analyzed. The results show that the gravity model, even in its basic form, is still powerful in explaining the trade volumes between Turkey and all other countries. In addition, the basic model is extended to analyze Turkey's trade with specific country groups such as the EU countries, the Islamic countries, the former Soviet Union countries, and the Central Asian countries. The analysis concludes that except for the Central Asian countries, Turkey's trade is not specialized with any particular country group. The 1995 Customs Union with the EU or any other step already taken towards full membership into the EU has not significantly increased Turkey's trade volume with the EU members over the amounts predicted by the basic version of the gravity model for any country pair of similar distance and GDP levels.","2012","[('C13', 'O19'), ('C13', 'F40'), ('C13', 'F14'), ('C13', 'F10'), ('C13', 'F15'), ('C51', 'O19'), ('C51', 'F40'), ('C51', 'F14'), ('C51', 'F10'), ('C51', 'F15')]","['O19', 'F40', 'F14', 'F10', 'F15', 'C13', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","1.0","0.1666666666666666","0.0","0.0","","","['O19', 'F40', 'F14', 'F10', 'F15']","['C13', 'C51']"

To face the current competitive environment, the regional airports in France adopted strategies, such as the construction of low-cost carrier (LCC)-dedicated terminals (LCCTs) with lower expenses to attract more LCCs, increasing non-aeronautical revenue, and hosting regional hubs of LCCs. This is the first study that analyzes all of the French regional airports.

For a wide range of 3,168 alternative implementations (design choices) of what could all constitute value portfolios, the authors document the impact of parameter pertubations on risk-adjusted returns. The observed dispersion in Sharpe ratios allows the authors to identify the hierarchy of design choices and to better assess the degrees of freedom consumed within the strategy development process. The authors can therefore derive critical t-values that adjust for overfitting. This will prove to be useful in research governance and strategy selection. <b>TOPICS:</b>Style investing, statistical methods <b>Key Findings</b> • Design choices create large variations in risk-adjusted returns. Characterizing factor investing as (scientific or smart) betas with no alpha underestimates the importance of skillfull choices. • Among design choices, signal definition is most important in explaining risk–return differences. However, even inferior signals can lead to significant performance gains when combined with selected portfolio construction choices, indicating the potential for data mining. • Investment firms with credible research governance need more awareness of the many degrees of freedom their research teams consume daily.

Of 8452 patients included, 30.8% were black, 27.6% white-Hispanic, 44.3% female and 28.0% lived in poor neighborhoods. A total of 63.4% of the study population was placed on the waiting list and 32.5% received a deceased donor transplant. Racial disparities persisted in transplant even after adjustment for SES, where minorities were less likely to receive a transplant compared to whites, and this disparity was more pronounced among patients 18-20 years.

However, the sector faces a number of risks including but not limited to production, technological, price and market risks, legal and personal risks. Price and exchange rate volatility is one of the main sources of risk in the agribusiness sector. This paper sought to determine if foreign income, exchange rate, relative prices, price and exchange rate volatility have effects on Kenya's black tea export demand. The study used panel data from World Bank and Central Bank of Kenya statistical bulletins for the period 1997 to 2010. Price and exchange volatility cannot be observed directly and were thus computed using Moving Average Standard Deviation (MASD) method. Sixteen major importer countries of Kenya's tea were considered in the study. Im Peseran and Shin (IPS) unit root tests were used for testing the variables for the presence of unit roots. The study employed dynamic heterogeneous panel techniques developed by Peseran and Shin using autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model in the error correction form. The empirical model was estimated using pooled mean group (PMG) estimator. The study found that growth in foreign income and changes in price and exchange rate volatility were significant in the long and short run. Proportional changes in relative prices and foreign exchange rate were insignificant in the long run and short run.

However, this scale can vary across individuals due to different perceptions on what are the right or appropriate bounds for Willingness To Pay (WTP). In this article, we test for scale-perception bias and propose a correction method based on the utilization of anchoring vignettes that define different degrees of preference for the nonmarket good.

The results indicate that there are some similarities and differences between the determinants of China's exports to these two countries. For example, an appreciation in the real exchange rate of the renminbi tends to have a significant negative impact on China's exports to both countries. However, the impact is much greater on Sino-U.S. trade than on Sino-Japanese trade due to China's higher dependence on Japan's intermediate goods. Empirical evidence also reveals that differences in income elasticities and economic growth rates might account for the more rapid increase in China's exports to the United States than to Japan.","2011","[('C51', 'F14'), ('C51', 'F41'), ('C51', 'O53'), ('C51', 'E65'), ('C51', 'F31'), ('C33', 'F14'), ('C33', 'F41'), ('C33', 'O53'), ('C33', 'E65'), ('C33', 'F31')]","['C51', 'F14', 'F41', 'O53', 'E65', 'F31', 'C33']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0666666666666666","0.1111111111111111","0.0","0.0","0.3333333333333333","0.75","['F14', 'F41', 'O53', 'E65', 'F31']","['C51', 'C33']"

Using project data, cost functions are estimated applying alternative functional forms. Results show that the average cost of abatement decreases with the volume of abatement, showing economies of scale and suggesting that reducing emissions through small projects is relatively expensive. Results also show significant variation in the costs of abatement by project type and location. Nevertheless, the observed distribution of project investments does not closely match the relative cost structure, either by location or project type. Renewable energy projects accounted for 62% of the projects even though they had the second highest cost. Most of the CDM projects are located in emerging economies, principally China, India, and Brazil, even though the fixed costs of establishing CDM projects in these countries are higher than in many other developing countries. Significantly, while much of the conceptual and applied numerical literature concerning greenhouse gas abatement policies relies on presumptions about the structure of abatement cost curves, these findings suggest that comparative advantage is only one of several factors driving CDM investments and that investors hold additional preferences about project location and project type. Finally, results indicate a general, though noncontinuous, downward trend in the costs of abatement for new CDM projects.","2015","[('C13', 'H23'), ('C13', 'O13'), ('C13', 'Q54'), ('C13', 'Q58'), ('C13', 'F18'), ('C51', 'H23'), ('C51', 'O13'), ('C51', 'Q54'), ('C51', 'Q58'), ('C51', 'F18')]","['H23', 'C51', 'O13', 'Q54', 'Q58', 'C13', 'F18']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0285714285714285","0.1066666666666666","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['H23', 'O13', 'Q54', 'Q58', 'F18']","['C13', 'C51']"

Medicare Advantage plans have gained financially from this favorable risk selection since their payments have traditionally been adjusted only minimally for clinical characteristics of enrollees, causing overpayment for healthier enrollees and underpayment for sicker ones. As a result, a new risk-adjustment system was phased in from 2004 to 2007, and a lock-in provision instituted to limit midyear disenrollment by enrollees experiencing health declines whose exodus could benefit plans financially. To determine whether these reforms were associated with intended reductions in risk selection, we compared differences in self-reported health care use and health between Medicare Advantage and traditional Medicare beneficiaries before versus after these reforms were implemented. We similarly compared differences between those who switched into or out of Medicare Advantage and nonswitchers. Most differences in 2001–03 were substantially narrowed by 2006–07, suggesting reduced selection. Similar risk-adjustment methods may help reduce incentives for plans competing in health insurance exchanges and accountable care organizations to select patients with favorable clinical risks.","2012","[('C21', 'G22'), ('C21', 'I11'), ('C21', 'H51'), ('C21', 'I13'), ('C21', 'H42'), ('C13', 'G22'), ('C13', 'I11'), ('C13', 'H51'), ('C13', 'I13'), ('C13', 'H42')]","['G22', 'I11', 'H51', 'C21', 'I13', 'C13', 'H42']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0557382539310603","0.1901344086021505","0.0","0.15625","","","['G22', 'I11', 'H51', 'I13', 'H42']","['C21', 'C13']"

Taken at face value, ICER is offering manufacturers and other interested parties the possibility of a greater involvement in the assessment of modeled claims for product pricing. The purpose of this commentary is to point to the obvious limitations to this policy and to raise questions as to the extent to which ICER is willing to commit to transparency in the creation of modeled claims. While a commitment to greater transparency is to be welcomed, the fact remains that the ICER methodology does not meet the standards of normal science. ICER modeled claims not only lack credibility but are impossible to evaluate or replicate in treating environments. In proposing greater transparency ICER runs the risk of undermining its own credibility. If manufacturers have the opportunity to generate alternative models which create alternative claims, then ICER runs the risk of its pole position in health technology assessment being questioned. Rather than focused on non-evaluable lifetime modeled claims, there is the opportunity for ICER to reject its current business model, accepting instead a modelling paradigm that is consistent with the standards of normal science.&#x0D; &#x0D; Type: Commentary","2018","[('C93', 'I11'), ('C93', 'H51'), ('C93', 'L65'), ('C93', 'I18'), ('C15', 'I11'), ('C15', 'H51'), ('C15', 'L65'), ('C15', 'I18'), ('C18', 'I11'), ('C18', 'H51'), ('C18', 'L65'), ('C18', 'I18')]","['C93', 'C15', 'I18', 'I11', 'H51', 'L65', 'C18']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['I11', 'H51', 'L65', 'I18']","['C93', 'C15', 'C18']"

The Role of Inpatient Care in Reducing Postdischarge Mortality","The Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the National Quality Forum have endorsed the 30-day mortality rate as an important indicator of hospital quality. Concerns have been raised, however, as to whether postdischarge mortality rates are reasonable measures of hospital quality as they consider the frequency of an event that occurs after a patient is discharged and is no longer under the watch and care of hospital staff. Estimating the causal effect of length of stay (LOS) on postdischarge mortality from retrospective data introduces a number of econometric challenges. We describe three potential sources of (endogeneity and censoring) biases and propose an approach that provides conservative estimates of the true treatment effect. Using a large data set comprising all hospital encounters of every Medicare fee-for-service patient with acute myocardial infarction from 2000 to 2011, we find evidence that an increase in LOS is associated with a decrease in 30-day mortality rates. An additional day in the hospital could decrease 30-day mortality rates by over 6%. Moreover, we find that, from a social planner’s perspective, the gains achieved in reducing mortality rates likely exceed the cost of keeping the patients in the hospital for an additional day.

The signals are divided into six equal segments on time scale for normalization. The first and sixth segments are considered as the nonfatigue and fatigue conditions, respectively. The source of multifractality can be due to correlation and probability distribution. The original sEMG series are transformed into shuffled and surrogate series. These three series namely, original, shuffled, and surrogate series in the nonfatigue and fatigue conditions are subjected to multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MFDFA) and features are extracted. The results indicate that sEMG signals exhibit multifractal behavior. Further investigation revealed that origin of multifractality is primarily due to correlation. The origin of multifractality due to correlation is quantified as 80% in nonfatigue and 86% in fatigue conditions. This method of multifractal analysis may be useful for analyzing the progressive changes in muscle contraction in varied neuromuscular studies.","2015","[('C14', 'I12'), ('C14', 'J28'), ('C63', 'I12'), ('C63', 'J28'), ('C02', 'I12'), ('C02', 'J28'), ('C01', 'I12'), ('C01', 'J28'), ('C18', 'I12'), ('C18', 'J28')]","['C14', 'C63', 'I12', 'J28', 'C02', 'C01', 'C18']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['I12', 'J28']","['C14', 'C63', 'C02', 'C01', 'C18']"

Design/methodology/approach – The study employed two different methodologies suggested by Christie and Huang (1995) and Chang et al. (2000) to test herd formation. Results are based on daily and monthly stock of KSE-100 index for the period 2002-2007. Findings – Results based on daily and monthly stock data from Karachi Stock Exchange indicate the non-existence of herd behavior for the period 2002-2007 and find no support for the rational asset pricing model and investor behavior found inefficient. This study denied proved evidence of herding due to market return asymmetry, high and low trading volume states and asymmetric market volatility. Macroeconomic fundamentals have insignificant role in decision-making process of investor therefore has no impact on herding behavior. However, during liquidity crisis of March 2005, Pakistani stock market exhibit herding behavior due to asymmetry of information among investors, presence of speculator and questionable badla financing-local leverage financing mechanism. Research limitations/implications – In future, this study can be improved by employing stock returns portfolios based on market capitalization or sector wise portfolio returns from KSE-100. Furthermore by identifying those factors that cause market to be overall inefficient and define the pattern of the investor trading activities. Practical implications – For an accurate valuation of assets investors should incorporate the herding factor. Social implications – As the assets are mispriced, investor behavior is uncertain and markets are inefficient, foreign investors should invest with caution, as large numbers of securities are needed to achieve the same level of diversification than in an otherwise normal market. Originality/value – In Karachi Stock Exchange, it is first attempt to uncover the herding behavior. This paper contribute to the body of knowledge by investigating the herding behavior in the emerging markets since most of the previous study concentrate more on the developed markets. Furthermore, the study also analyzed the herding behavior in different economic condition and includes economic variables and examines asymmetric effect. This study presents an integrated model to test herding behavior in Pakistani equity market. Consideration of said behavioral effect in the decision-making process of investor will make the decisions more rational and optimal.","2015","[('C22', 'O16'), ('C22', 'G14'), ('C22', 'E44'), ('C22', 'G02'), ('C22', 'G01'), ('C12', 'O16'), ('C12', 'G14'), ('C12', 'E44'), ('C12', 'G02'), ('C12', 'G01')]","['O16', 'G14', 'C22', 'E44', 'C12', 'G01', 'G02']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['O16', 'G14', 'E44', 'G01']","['C22', 'C12']"

There have been no further scientific studies on delay since then, despite developments that may exacerbate the issue like increased legalism and expanded arbitral jurisdiction. Academics and practitioners have recently voiced renewed concerns about the threat that delay poses to the viability of the grievance arbitration system. To address this gap in the scientific literature, the present study examines delay and its determinants in Ontario over the last two decades. Content analysis was conducted on a random sample of almost 400 Ontario grievance arbitrations from three reference years (1994, 2004, and 2012). I then performed event history analysis on the data to determine the various factors that were associated with delay. Consistent with common perception, my empirical results suggest that delay has become worse over the past two decades. I find that certain legalistic factors are indeed associated with delay, including the use of lawyers, the use of preliminary objections, the number of witnesses testifying, and attacks on credibility. In terms of expanded arbitral jurisdiction, I find that while delay has increased for grievances involving alleged Employment Standards Act violations, for all other non-traditional issues (including human rights complaints) there are no significant increases. The results also show that certain dispute resolution procedures, such as expedited arbitration and the use of sole arbitrators are related to shorter grievance durations, and this, combined with the other findings, suggests practical solutions to the issue of delay. However, the findings also suggest that the use of certain procedures involving additional steps, like settlement and mediation-arbitration, can also serve to increase grievance duration when used unsuccessfully.","2018","[('C41', 'J53'), ('C41', 'K41'), ('C41', 'K31'), ('C41', 'M51'), ('C41', 'J52'), ('C14', 'J53'), ('C14', 'K41'), ('C14', 'K31'), ('C14', 'M51'), ('C14', 'J52')]","['C14', 'J53', 'C41', 'K41', 'K31', 'M51', 'J52']","False","True","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['J53', 'K41', 'K31', 'M51', 'J52']","['C41', 'C14']"

The chaotic features are justified numerically via computing Lyapunov numbers and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. Also, we show that in the case of quadratic costs there are stable trajectories and a higher (lower) degree of product differentiation does not tend to destabilize the economy.","2015","[('C61', 'D21'), ('C61', 'L13'), ('C61', 'D43'), ('C61', 'L11'), ('C02', 'D21'), ('C02', 'L13'), ('C02', 'D43'), ('C02', 'L11'), ('C73', 'D21'), ('C73', 'L13'), ('C73', 'D43'), ('C73', 'L11')]","['D21', 'C61', 'L11', 'C02', 'D43', 'L13', 'C73']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['D21', 'L13', 'D43', 'L11']","['C61', 'C02', 'C73']"

This is because a key model input–namely the valuation of centennial climate damage–is highly unknowable for fundamental reasons discussed here. Problems with damage valuation are highlighted by the implicit implausibility to climate scientists of a leading model's (centennial) damage function, and by strong criticisms of damage functions by many climate economists. The claim that statistical analyses of past weather impacts on local economies, combined with structural modeling of sectoral impacts, can significantly improve centennial damage valuation rests on untestable, far‐out‐of‐sample extrapolation. Testing centennial climate (natural) science projections is generally harder than testing predictions in astronomy, geology and other earth sciences, because of Earth's uniqueness, and the unprecedented degree of likely climate change; but stable underlying laws make climate modeling based on past observations meaningful. By contrast, the added complexity of human behavior means there are no quantitatively stable laws for modeling the value of centennial climate damage. I suggest that any carbon prices used to inform climate policies, be they carbon prices used as policy instruments, or complementary, non‐carbon‐price policies, should instead be based on marginal abatement costs, found by modeling low‐cost pathways to socially agreed, physical climate targets. A pathway approach to estimating carbon prices poses challenges to many economists, and is no panacea, but it avoids any illusion of optimality, and facilitates detailed analysis of sectoral policies.

Quantitative analysis of changes in the wage gap, adjusted for key determinants, is based on data from the Current Population Survey (CPS). Examination of these data suggests that the gender earnings gap is persistent despite frequent claims to the contrary from industry surveys and that the gap is narrower for professional level positions.

In a recent article published in this Journal , Robert Allen argues that only in England was the price of labor relative to capital high enough to justify the adoption of the labor-saving technologies which characterized the Industrial Revolution. 1 To support his argument, he uses the spinning jenny as a case study. The jenny was indeed an important labor-saving technology that was invented and widely adopted in England but not in France. Allen explains this fact by calculating the returns to adopting the jenny in each country: according to his calculations the jenny was profitable in England but not in France. The present note shows that Allen's conclusions rest on implausible profitability computations. In particular, Allen assumes that output remains constant after the adoption of the jenny while hours worked decrease dramatically. From a theoretical perspective, this is equivalent to an assumption that hours worked move inversely with the marginal product of labor. As soon as these restrictive assumptions are abandoned, the jenny turns out being profitable both in England and in France. Hence the mystery of the adoption of the jenny during the Industrial Revolution remains.","2011","[('C61', 'N10'), ('C61', 'O33'), ('C61', 'J23'), ('C61', 'D24'), ('C61', 'N63'), ('B41', 'N10'), ('B41', 'O33'), ('B41', 'J23'), ('B41', 'D24'), ('B41', 'N63')]","['C61', 'B41', 'N10', 'O33', 'J23', 'D24', 'N63']","True","True","False","False","True","True","0.5416666666666666","0.4444444444444444","0.0","0.0","0.6666666666666666","1.0","['N10', 'O33', 'J23', 'D24', 'N63']","['C61', 'B41']"

The method is built recursively and involves the conditional distribution of the marginals of the discrete Euler process. Analytically, the method raises several questions like the analysis of the induced quadratic quantization error between the marginals of the Euler process and the proposed quantizations. We show in particular that at every discretization step tk of the Euler scheme, this error is bounded by the cumulative quantization errors induced by the Euler operator, from times t0 = 0 to time tk. For numerics, we restrict our analysis to the one-dimensional setting and show how to compute the optimal grids using a Newton–Raphson algorithm. We then propose a closed formula for the companion weights and the transition probabilities associated to the proposed quantizations. This allows us to quantize in particular diffusion processes in local volatility models by reducing dramatically the computational complexity of the search of optimal quantizers while increasing their computational precision with respect to the algorithms commonly proposed in this framework. Numerical tests are carried out for the Brownian motion and for the pricing of European options in a local volatility model.

By deterring selection, risk adjustment helps to assure fair and efficient payments among health insurers or capitated provider groups. However, since conventional risk adjustment allocates funds among regions or insurers according to current population health status, it does not reward – indeed, it penalizes – preventive efforts that improve population health. This prevention penalty of risk adjustment represents a hidden cost of unclear magnitude, undermining provider incentives for health promotion. We develop a theoretical model of selection and prevention demonstrating this problem with conventional risk adjustment and suggesting a simple alternative: risk adjustment should be linked to pay‐for‐performance for prevention.","2012","[('C61', 'G22'), ('C61', 'I11'), ('C61', 'H51'), ('C61', 'D82'), ('C61', 'I13'), ('C73', 'G22'), ('C73', 'I11'), ('C73', 'H51'), ('C73', 'D82'), ('C73', 'I13')]","['C61', 'G22', 'I11', 'H51', 'D82', 'I13', 'C73']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.1369703355781626","0.1366524030182767","0.0","0.45","0.0","0.4","['G22', 'I11', 'H51', 'D82', 'I13']","['C61', 'C73']"

While legal unbundling is already implemented in most countries and indisputable in its necessity for approaching regulatory aims, continuative models such as ownership unbundling are still ambiguous. The following article contributes to the economic analysis of identifying the differences of these separate types of unbundling by concentrating on competition effects and the possibility to conceal true marginal costs. Via simulation, we find that legal unbundling yields the lowest prices in a market under Cournot competition. Moreover, under Bertrand competition, no differences between legal unbundling and ownership unbundling can be identified.","2012","[('C15', 'D21'), ('C15', 'L51'), ('C15', 'L11'), ('C15', 'D43'), ('C15', 'Q41'), ('C63', 'D21'), ('C63', 'L51'), ('C63', 'L11'), ('C63', 'D43'), ('C63', 'Q41')]","['D21', 'L51', 'C63', 'C15', 'L11', 'D43', 'Q41']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.025","0.1666666666666666","0.0","0.0","0.5","0.5","['D21', 'L51', 'L11', 'D43', 'Q41']","['C15', 'C63']"

Although GTAA can improve returns over a buy-and-hold strategy, more tactical trading (when profitable) typically leads to higher tax bills. If investors are careless about tax management, the GTAA alpha can easily be swamped by increased taxes. In response, many investors have been quick to embrace passive buy-and-hold strategies for which low turnover results in a lower tax bill. However, rather than abandoning GTAA in favor of lower taxes, investors can apply well-documented tax management methods of loss harvesting and tax-lot selection in their tactical trading.

In this paper, we investigate the German pilot auction scheme for solar photovoltaics introduced in the Renewable Energies Act 2014 (EEG 2014) that serves as a pilot for the auctionbased promotion of the three major large-scale renewable electricity generation technologies (wind, solar, biomass) as of 2017. A strategic bidding model is used to determine the optimal bidding strategy and to determine the resulting project value. We consider pay-as-bid and uniform pricing and single and multiple bids. Moreover, we investigate the impact of investment cost uncertainty. In a sensitivity analysis we show how bid strategy adjustments affect the outcome. Specifically, higher uncertainty regarding the market clearing price increases the project value, as this additional uncertainty can be used to raise the probability of obtaining a higher level of remuneration by an adjusted auction strategy. The first- price auction can generate additional profits by placing a second, higher bid with a low probability of success. Investment cost uncertainty can have either a positive or negative impact on the project value, depending on the auction parameter values chosen.","2017","[('C71', 'Q42'), ('C71', 'D44'), ('C71', 'Q48'), ('C71', 'L94'), ('C71', 'D81'), ('C63', 'Q42'), ('C63', 'D44'), ('C63', 'Q48'), ('C63', 'L94'), ('C63', 'D81')]","['Q42', 'C63', 'D44', 'C71', 'Q48', 'L94', 'D81']","False","True","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['Q42', 'D44', 'Q48', 'L94', 'D81']","['C71', 'C63']"

Against this background, this study investigated the roles of the aged in the Sotho family system and society in order to document it thereafter. The study was conducted in five villages, namely Matsieng, Phahameng, Scott Hospital area and Ha-Folene in Morija, 41 kilometers south of Maseru the capital town of Lesotho. It made use of 20 purposively selected individuals from the population of the study which consisted of the elderly in their different ages and categories. The sample was reached through the use of snowball method as the target respondents were those who were sixty-five years old or above. Key informant and in-depth interviews were used as the main sources of data collection. Based on the motivation and objective of the study, found that the elderly were actively involved in some critical roles within their families and society. There roles include socialisation and educational functions, protective and mystical functions, medicinal and healing functions, leadership, social functions and various contributions to the economic production of the Sotho society. They are specialised areas that are cut out for the elderly. For instance, rendering sacrifice to appease the gods can only be performed by the elderly because they are regarded as a link between the living and the past generations. This study concludes that these roles performed by the elderly place them strategically in scheme of things, which means the recognition of their relevance to the society still persists, even though they might look physically frail and weak.","2012","[('C93', 'J11'), ('C93', 'O15'), ('C93', 'J14'), ('C93', 'I31'), ('C93', 'Z13'), ('C81', 'J11'), ('C81', 'O15'), ('C81', 'J14'), ('C81', 'I31'), ('C81', 'Z13')]","['J11', 'C93', 'O15', 'J14', 'I31', 'Z13', 'C81']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['J11', 'O15', 'J14', 'I31', 'Z13']","['C93', 'C81']"

The extensive literature on this subject includes wage decompositions that divide the gender wage gap into ""explained"" and ""unexplained"" components. One of the problems with this approach is the heterogeneity of the sample data. In order to address the difficulties of comparing like with like, this study uses a number of different matching techniques to obtain estimates of the gap. By controlling for a wide range of other influences, in effect, we estimate the direct effect of simply being female on wages. However, a number of other factors, such as parenthood, gender segregation, part-time working, and unionization, contribute to the gender wage gap. This means that it is not just the core ""like for like"" comparison between male and female wages that matters but also how gender wage differences interact with other influences. The literature has noted the existence of these interactions, but precise or systematic estimates of such effects remain scarce. The most innovative contribution of this study is to do that. Our findings imply that the idea of a single uniform gender pay gap is perhaps less useful than an understanding of how gender wages are shaped by multiple different forces.","2019","[('C21', 'I32'), ('C21', 'J16'), ('C21', 'J31'), ('C21', 'J71'), ('C14', 'I32'), ('C14', 'J16'), ('C14', 'J31'), ('C14', 'J71'), ('C10', 'I32'), ('C10', 'J16'), ('C10', 'J31'), ('C10', 'J71')]","['I32', 'J31', 'C14', 'J71', 'J16', 'C10', 'C21']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.25","0.4666666666666666","['I32', 'J16', 'J31', 'J71']","['C21', 'C14', 'C10']"

Based on the above study, we use an optimized input‐output model to evaluate the economic ripple effect (ERE) of the United States on the world due to climate change under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 with different increases in the annual mean temperature (AMT; 1, 1.5, and 2°C) between 2020 and 2100. The results show that if a loss of gross domestic product of 0.88% occurs with a 1°C AMT increase in the United States, the ERE of approximately 0.12% will be generated onto the global gross domestic product; with a 2°C increase, the ERE will triple. The time variation trend of the ERE conforms to the future variations in AMT. The degree of this effect on other regions of the world is closely related to the trade links between the United States and economic aggregates. Among these regions, Canada shows the greatest impact, followed by China. The ERE that China suffers may increase by 4.5 times as the AMT in the United States increases from 1 to 2°C. In cold regions, the benefit from global warming will decrease due to the ERE from other regions, which will inhibit their economic development. This paper aims to provide new perspectives and data‐based support for regions around the world to cope with climate change and to develop policies by studying the ERE behind international trade.","2018","[('C61', 'E66'), ('C61', 'Q56'), ('C61', 'Q54'), ('C61', 'O44'), ('C61', 'F18'), ('C67', 'E66'), ('C67', 'Q56'), ('C67', 'Q54'), ('C67', 'O44'), ('C67', 'F18')]","['E66', 'C61', 'C67', 'Q56', 'Q54', 'O44', 'F18']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['E66', 'Q56', 'Q54', 'O44', 'F18']","['C61', 'C67']"

Our proposed approach performs well in Monte Carlo simulations. Using our approach, we successfully replicate the estimated relationship between income and democracy in Bonhomme and Manresa and the group characteristics when we use the same number of groups. Furthermore, we find that the optimal number of groups could depend on model specifications on heteroskedasticity and discuss ways to choose models in practice.","2019","[('C11', 'D31'), ('C11', 'O47'), ('C11', 'P16'), ('C13', 'D31'), ('C13', 'O47'), ('C13', 'P16'), ('C51', 'D31'), ('C51', 'O47'), ('C51', 'P16'), ('C33', 'D31'), ('C33', 'O47'), ('C33', 'P16')]","['C11', 'D31', 'O47', 'P16', 'C13', 'C51', 'C33']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.25","0.0","['D31', 'O47', 'P16']","['C11', 'C13', 'C51', 'C33']"

We examine patterns of closures among private-run primary care clinics (PCCs) in California between 2006 and 2012. We use a discrete-time proportional hazard model to assess relative hazard ratios of covariates, and a random-effect hazard model to adjust for unobserved heterogeneity among PCCs. We find that lower net income from patient care, smaller amount of government grants, and lower productivity were associated with significantly higher risk of PCC closure. We also find that federally qualified health centers and nonfederally qualified health centers generally faced the same risk factors of closure.

Although a patient experiences transitions in continuous time, assessments on the patient are often made at irregularly spaced time points. In this paper, the authors formulate a Markov 4-state model for examining longitudinal data on performance status collected under intermittent observation. The cohort consisted of 11,342 patients diagnosed with cancer in Ontario, Canada, from 2007 to 2009.

By adopting the Bai and Perron model this paper found that there were six structural breaks in the Brent oil price due to major global events and that ARDL-ECM cointegration exists only between oil price and stock market volatility index (VIX) throughout the sampling period. However, cointegration relations were found between oil price and Crude Oil Volatility Index (OVX) in the second and fourth sub-periods, and also between oil price and VIX in the second, third, fourth, sixth, and seventh sub-periods. Furthermore, the cointegration relation coupled with correlation analysis indicates a long-term equilibrium positive (negative) relation between the two variables. Such relations existed between the price and the two fear gauges, respectively, only for some specific sub-periods, implying that OVX seemed to be better than VIX in predicting oil price changes. We suggest that the investors in the global oil market must pay attention to not only the impacts of major global political and economic events on oil price, but also the positive or negative correlations between oil price and fear gauge.","2019","[('C32', 'Q43'), ('C32', 'G15'), ('C32', 'G17'), ('C32', 'E31'), ('C32', 'F47'), ('C51', 'Q43'), ('C51', 'G15'), ('C51', 'G17'), ('C51', 'E31'), ('C51', 'F47')]","['Q43', 'G15', 'C32', 'G17', 'E31', 'F47', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['Q43', 'G15', 'G17', 'E31', 'F47']","['C32', 'C51']"

We show that the transmission is asymmetric depending on the extention of the deviation of the actual policy rate from the one required by the Taylor rule.

Strong concerns have been raised about whether the risk of ischemic stroke differs between risperidone and haloperidol. This study compared the risk of ischemic stroke between elderly patients taking risperidone and haloperidol. Method: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Korea Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database, applying a propensity-matched analysis. The cohort consisted of elderly patients who were newly prescribed haloperidol or risperidone between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2009. Patients with prior cerebrovascular diseases (ICD-10, I60–I69), transient ischemic attack (ICD-10, G45), or cerebral tumors (ICD-10, C31) during 365 days prior to the initiation date were excluded. The study subjects were selected by propensity score matching. The outcome was defined as the first hospitalization for ischemic stroke (ICD-10, I63). Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for ischemic stroke with haloperidol compared with risperidone use. Results: A total of 14,103 patients were included in the propensity-matched cohort for each drug. Overall, the incidence rate was higher for haloperidol users compared to the risperidone users (6.43 per 1000 person-years vs. 2.88 per 1000 person-years). A substantially increased risk was observed in haloperidol users (adjusted HR = 2.02, 95% CI, 1.12–3.62).

The positive asymmetry in equities and its decline with the progressive elimination of the short-sale restriction on equities support the costly short-sale hypothesis, which considers a costly short-sale restriction or asymmetric transaction costs on long and short trading to be the source of the asymmetry. The part of a less positive asymmetry in ETFs also consists with what the costly short-sale hypothesis predicts. The later information models that consider asymmetrically-informed traders or the heterogeneity of traders to be the source of the asymmetry explain the negative asymmetry in ETFs and the upward trend in the magnitude of volume-return correlation with the grow of volume quintiles. An important conclusion is that not a single hypothesis can be a universal explanation for the asymmetric volume-return relationship.

Using a panel set of Tunisian commercial banks during the period spanning from 1997 to 2007, our study puts in evidence that stringent capital requirements help deterring the bank risk taking. Similarly, banks with high franchise value may have an incentive to avoid risky business strategies. However, empirical findings clearly bring forth that the intensity of such decrease varies with the risk taking measurement. Capital regulation allows reducing both the market risk and the insolvency risk but has no effect on the specific risk of the bank; while the franchise value has a negative effect on only the market risk of the bank. Overall, our study indicates that capital allocation should be more risk sensitive and that the whole bank risk taking ought to be deeply investigated and quantified.","2012","[('C23', 'G21'), ('C23', 'G28'), ('C23', 'G32'), ('C23', 'E58'), ('C23', 'D82'), ('C33', 'G21'), ('C33', 'G28'), ('C33', 'G32'), ('C33', 'E58'), ('C33', 'D82')]","['G21', 'G28', 'G32', 'E58', 'C23', 'D82', 'C33']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.2083333333333333","0.25","0.0","0.0","","","['G21', 'G28', 'G32', 'E58', 'D82']","['C23', 'C33']"

CER studies for prescribers should be designed and implemented to inform evidence-based therapeutic guidelines, providing actionable information from their everyday practice use. The challenge is how to conduct CER studies that satisfy the simultaneous requirements of scientific rigor and applicability to the respective decision makers. One solution is to address the demand for “real-world” data (RWD) by involving decision makers and other key stakeholders early on in the development of the research designs and implementation of study protocols when conducting CER studies. RWD have been defined “as data used for decision-making that are not collected in conventional RCTs” (randomized controlled trials);2 therefore, the ability to gather input from the payer is essential to ensure collected endpoints are applicable to the decision makers themselves. RCTs are considered the “gold standard” for providing evidence about a product’s efficacy and are the basis for supporting formulary decision making. While the internal validity of RCTs is well known and established, the controlled protocols of RCTs may not have the desired level of external validity for a managed care organization’s (MCO) population. Consequently, health care decision makers are examining other sources of data to supplement RCTs for their health care coverage policies. Health care providers and payers use available evidence from both RCTs and RWD sources to decide whether a particular drug product offers tangible clinical benefits and value compared with existing therapies. Improving medical outcomes and providing positive impact on health care expenditures are shared goals of providers, payers, and the pharmaceutical industry.3","2011","[('C93', 'M11'), ('C93', 'I18'), ('C93', 'I11'), ('C93', 'H51'), ('C93', 'L65'), ('C14', 'M11'), ('C14', 'I18'), ('C14', 'I11'), ('C14', 'H51'), ('C14', 'L65')]","['C93', 'C14', 'M11', 'I18', 'I11', 'H51', 'L65']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0634920634920634","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['M11', 'I18', 'I11', 'H51', 'L65']","['C93', 'C14']"

Joint liability is deduced to be the preferable regime for the policyholder in cost-savings terms if corporate income taxation is introduced as a market friction.

As a result, there have been efforts to more logically and rigorously evaluate GHE projects and programs; many of these have been based on the Logic and Results Frameworks. However, while these Frameworks are apt and appropriate planning tools, they are not ideally suited to measuring programs' effectiveness. This article introduces military medicine professionals to the Measures of Effectiveness for Defense Engagement and Learning (MODEL) program, which implements a new method of assessment, one that seeks to rigorously use Measures of Effectiveness (vs. Measures of Performance) to gauge programs' and projects' success and fidelity to Theater Campaign goals. While the MODEL method draws on the Logic and Results Frameworks where appropriate, it goes beyond their planning focus by using the latest social scientific and econometric evaluation methodologies to link on-the-ground GHE ""lines of effort"" to the realization of national and strategic goals and end-states. It is hoped these methods will find use beyond the MODEL project itself, and will catalyze a new body of rigorous, empirically based work, which measures the effectiveness of a broad spectrum of GHE and security cooperation activities.

Moreover, some of them have become more intense — the eurocrisis, excessive debts, global liquidity glut against the backdrop of its deficit in some of market segments.

A three-armed randomised controlled trial of the effect of financial Incentives in Diabetic Eye Assessment by Screening (IDEAS) trial","Conflicting evidence exists regarding the impact of financial incentives on encouraging attendance at medical screening appointments. The primary aim was to determine whether financial incentives increase attendance at diabetic eye screening in persistent non-attenders.A three-armed randomised controlled trial was conducted in London in 2015. 1051 participants aged over 16 years, who had not attended eye screening appointments for 2 years or more, were randomised (1.4:1:1 randomisation ratio) to receive the usual invitation letter (control), an offer of £10 cash for attending screening (fixed incentive) or a 1 in 100 chance of winning £1000 (lottery incentive) if they attend. The primary outcome was the proportion of invitees attending screening, and a comparative analysis was performed to assess group differences. Pairwise comparisons of attendance rates were performed, using a conservative Bonferroni correction for independent comparisons.34/435 (7.8%) of control, 17/312 (5.5%) of fixed incentive and 10/304 (3.3%) of lottery incentive groups attended. Participants who received any incentive were significantly less likely to attend their appointment compared with controls (risk ratio (RR)=0.56; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.92). Those in the probabilistic incentive group (RR=0.42; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.98), but not the fixed incentive group (RR=1.66; 95% CI 0.65 to 4.21), were significantly less likely to attend than those in the control group.Financial incentives, particularly lottery-based incentives, attract fewer patients to diabetic eye screening than standard invites in this population. Financial incentives should not be used to promote screening unless tested in context, as they may negatively affect attendance rates.","2018","[('C93', 'H41'), ('C93', 'D12'), ('C93', 'I12'), ('C93', 'I18'), ('C93', 'D03'), ('C15', 'H41'), ('C15', 'D12'), ('C15', 'I12'), ('C15', 'I18'), ('C15', 'D03')]","['C93', 'H41', 'D12', 'I12', 'C15', 'I18', 'D03']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0050125313283208","0.0167763157894736","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['H41', 'D12', 'I12', 'I18']","['C93', 'C15']"

Stock-specific information demand positively predicts speculative trading activity. Furthermore, we find a positive relationship between market-wide information demand and order aggressiveness and order uncertainty for speculating and investing activity. Whereas information supply is associated with speculative long positions, information demand does not induce investors to be predominantly long or short. Finally, we do not find retail investor information demand to contribute to an upward price pressure on security prices. In contrast, information supply exerts negative price pressure. Overall, retail investor trading in individual stocks is much more strongly influenced by market-wide information demand instead of firm-specific information demand.

This paper uses critical discourse analysis to examine how these competing interests with respect to house price rises are represented in popular discourse. It systematically analyses newspaper coverage, comparing two time periods, one relatively stable and the second a period of rising house prices. This analysis exposes the powerful influence of industry insiders in creating the discourse of the housing market news, and how price rises are positioned as both beneficial and the 'natural order'. Analysing the metaphoric representations of housing markets allows a closer interrogation of the ideological construct that associates a 'healthy' housing market as one of continuous price rises and shows how these discourses are deeply embedded, in ways that limit the scope for imagining an alternative house market functioning.","2018","[('C82', 'R11'), ('C82', 'D12'), ('C82', 'G21'), ('C82', 'P16'), ('C82', 'R31'), ('B41', 'R11'), ('B41', 'D12'), ('B41', 'G21'), ('B41', 'P16'), ('B41', 'R31')]","['B41', 'D12', 'R11', 'G21', 'P16', 'C82', 'R31']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.2261904761904762","0.1452380952380952","['R11', 'D12', 'G21', 'P16', 'R31']","['C82', 'B41']"

Unlike the homogenous assumption used in the previous studies, the mixed logit model of choice experiment method was applied to estimate respondents’ heterogeneous willingness to pay for farmland non-market value (represented by farmland area, farmland fertility, water quality, air quality, species richness, and recreational value) in this study. Data came from a sample of 289 farmers in Wuhan, China who were face-to-face interviewed. Results showed that: (1) Farmers were unsatisfied with the status quo of the present farmland ecological environment and were willing to pay to preserve all the attributes of farmland non-market value. (2) Farmers had a heterogeneous preference for the status quo and recreational value—the error variances of these two attributes were both significant at the 1% level, and their willingness to pay for the farmland non-market value in Wuhan was 1141.88 Yuan/hm2. (3) Farmers’ cognition degree of farmland importance and whether respondents bought medical insurance or not had significant impacts on their willingness to pay.

The estimation of research expenditures on cardiovascular disease in Canada","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of death in Canada and is a priority area for medical research. The research funding landscape in Canada has changed quite a bit over the last few decades, as have funding levels. Our objective was to estimate the magnitude of expenditures on CVD research for the public and charitable (not-for profit) sectors in Canada between 1975 and 2005. To estimate research expenditures for the public and charitable sectors, we compiled a complete list of granting agencies in Canada, contacted each agency and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), and extracted data from the organizations’ annual reports and the Reference Lists of health research in Canada. Two independent reviewers scanned all grant and fellowship/scholarship titles (and summary/key words, when available) of all research projects funded to determine their inclusion in our analysis; only grants and fellowships/scholarships that focused on heart and peripheral vascular diseases were selected. Public/charitable sector funding increased 7.5 times, from close to $13 million (in constant dollars) in 1975 to almost $96 million (in constant dollars) in 2005 (base year). The Medical Research Council of Canada (MRCC)/CIHR and the Heart & Stroke Foundation of Canada have been the main founders of this type of research during our analysis period; the Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research and the Fonds de la recherche en santé du Quebec have played major roles at the provincial level. The Indirect Costs Research Program and Canada Foundation for Innovation have played major roles in terms of funding in the last years of our analysis. Public/charitable-funded research expenditures devoted to CVD have increased substantially over the last three decades. By international standards, the evidence suggests Canada spends less on health-related research than the UK and the US, at least in absolute terms. However, this may not be too problematic as Canada is likely to free-ride from research undertaken elsewhere. Understanding these past trends in research funding may provide decision makers with important information for planning future research efforts. Future work in this area should include the use of our coding methods to obtain estimates of funded research for other diseases in Canada.","2012","[('C43', 'N32'), ('C43', 'I10'), ('C43', 'H41'), ('C43', 'I19'), ('C43', 'H51'), ('C82', 'N32'), ('C82', 'I10'), ('C82', 'H41'), ('C82', 'I19'), ('C82', 'H51')]","['N32', 'I10', 'H41', 'I19', 'H51', 'C82', 'C43']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.2832358674463938","0.2912422470317207","0.0","0.1666666666666666","0.75","0.75","['N32', 'I10', 'H41', 'I19', 'H51']","['C43', 'C82']"

The absence of diagnostic information was used as a measure of data quality. We analysed differences in complexity for each of the 30 Healthcare Resource Groups (HRGs) that together account for 78% of coded private treatment centre activity. Statistical significance was assessed at the 1% level.Hospitals and treatment centres.Patient complexity was assessed by four characteristics: age; number of diagnoses; number of procedures; and income deprivation of residential area.NHS providers treated almost 7 million adult elective patients in 2007-2008. Fewer than 100,000 patients were treated by private providers (1.3% of elective activity). Less than 1% of NHS patients lacked diagnostic information compared to 36% of patients treated by private providers. For the top 30 HRGs, NHS patients had significantly (p<0.01) higher levels of co-morbidity, underwent more procedures and were more likely to come from deprived areas compared with patients treated by private providers. Although patients treated in private settings tended to be younger, the difference was not statistically significant.Some private companies provide poor quality data.

The model is applied to three cases of improved crops, which either are, or are expected to be, delayed by the regulatory process. The benefits and costs of the crops are presented in a partial equilibrium that considers changes in adoption over time and the foregone benefits caused by a delay in approval under irreversibility and uncertainty. We derive the equilibrium conditions where the net-benefits of the technology equal the costs that would justify a delay. The sooner information about the safety of the technology arrive, the lower the costs for justifying a delay need to be i.e. it pays more to delay. The costs of a delay can be substantial: e.g. a one year delay in approval of the pod-borer resistant cowpea in Nigeria will cost the country about 33 million USD to 46 million USD and between 100 and 3,000 lives.","2017","[('C61', 'D61'), ('C61', 'I12'), ('C61', 'O33'), ('C61', 'Q18'), ('C61', 'Q16'), ('C02', 'D61'), ('C02', 'I12'), ('C02', 'O33'), ('C02', 'Q18'), ('C02', 'Q16')]","['D61', 'C61', 'I12', 'O33', 'C02', 'Q18', 'Q16']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0034013605442176","0.1","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.6666666666666666","['D61', 'I12', 'O33', 'Q18', 'Q16']","['C61', 'C02']"

A novel multilayer network framework is applied to link debt and equity exposures across countries. Use of this approach—that examines simultaneously multiple channels of transmission and their important higher order effects—shows that ignoring the heterogeneity of financial exposures, and simply aggregating all claims, as often done in other studies, can underestimate the extent and effects of financial contagion.The structure of the global financial network has changed since the global financial crisis, impacted by European bank’s deleveraging and higher corporate debt issuance. Still, we find that the structure of the system and contagion remain similar in that network is highly susceptible to shocks from central countries and those with large financial systems (e.g., the USA and the UK). While, individual European countries (excluding the UK) have relatively low impact on shock propagation, the network is highly susceptible to the shocks from the entire euro area. Another important development is the rising role of the Asian countries and the noticeable increase in network susceptibility to shocks from China and Hong Kong SAR economies.","2018","[('C45', 'G15'), ('C45', 'F42'), ('C45', 'E44'), ('C45', 'F30'), ('C45', 'G01'), ('C63', 'G15'), ('C63', 'F42'), ('C63', 'E44'), ('C63', 'F30'), ('C63', 'G01')]","['C45', 'C63', 'G15', 'F42', 'E44', 'F30', 'G01']","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","0.0","0.0","0.1666666666666666","0.0","['G15', 'F42', 'E44', 'F30', 'G01']","['C45', 'C63']"

In this context, I study the equilibrium dynamics of limit order markets. Continuous idiosyncratic liquidity shocks result in trades on both sides of the order book. News therefore arrives at random times. Following news, order flows become unbalanced and market depth is consumed, leading to positive covariance between price variability, trading volume, and order book unbalances. Holding the unconditional price variability constant, news frequency has a negative effect on both market depth and the variability‐volume covariance.","2018","[('C15', 'G01'), ('C15', 'G13'), ('C15', 'D53'), ('C15', 'G14'), ('C51', 'G01'), ('C51', 'G13'), ('C51', 'D53'), ('C51', 'G14'), ('C58', 'G01'), ('C58', 'G13'), ('C58', 'D53'), ('C58', 'G14')]","['G13', 'C15', 'G14', 'D53', 'G01', 'C51', 'C58']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0116279069767441","0.0","0.0","1.0","1.0","['G01', 'G13', 'D53', 'G14']","['C15', 'C51', 'C58']"

Time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model is used to capture time-varying nature of Diebold and Yilmaz (2014) connectedness network. Rapid increases in connectedness during the sample period are mostly associated with housing booms rather than downturns. The connectedness cycles for the whole country and for Seoul seem to diverge after the global financial crisis. During the 2006 and 2018 connectedness surge episodes, when housing booms were driven by the Seoul metropolitan area, Seoul and the surrounding Gyeonggi province had a strong influence on the whole country network. However, their impact was much weaker in 2010–2011 when the housing boom arose outside Seoul. The influence of Gangnam-3 districts in Seoul's connectedness network is low overall, but tends to lead the total connectedness index by a few months.","2019","[('C53', 'E32'), ('C53', 'R11'), ('C53', 'R30'), ('C53', 'G01'), ('C53', 'R31'), ('C32', 'E32'), ('C32', 'R11'), ('C32', 'R30'), ('C32', 'G01'), ('C32', 'R31')]","['E32', 'R11', 'C32', 'R30', 'C53', 'G01', 'R31']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['E32', 'R11', 'R30', 'G01', 'R31']","['C53', 'C32']"

This study tested for the long run price adjustment behaviour between the producer price of captured fish and its urban or retailed price in the Southern region of Nigeria. Monthly price of low quality fresh fish; high quality fresh fish; low quality dry fish; high quality dry fish; imported fish; cocokle, periwinkle, dry Bonga fish; and dried cray fish were used in the study. The study covers the period from January 2004 to December 2014. The study used the Engle –Granger (1987) and Enders - Siklos (2001) methodologies to verify the symmetric and asymmetric price relationship between the source (fisherman price) and its corresponding urban price alone the food chain. The result confirmed significant short and long run market integration between the source and its corresponding urban price. However, the source price equilibrium in the long run followed asymmetric adjustment with respect to urban prices in cockle and periwinkle; whereas symmetric adjustments were obtained from prices of low quality fresh fish; high quality fresh fish; low quality dry fish; high quality dry fish; imported fish; dry Bonga fish; and dried cray fish. The symmetric price adjustment was not instantaneous, while the asymmetric price relationship showed persistent positive shock in the long run. It is suggested that, fish market/industry in the study area has problems that need intervention in order to remove price distortion in the long run. Issues such contract fishing, large intermediaries in the marketing chain, unnecessary market power and poor processing among others were mentioned. Hence, these issues need to be addressed adequately in order to achieve high efficiency in the local fishing industry in the region.Keywords: Market integration, asymmetric price transmission, symmetric transmission, fishery, Nigeria","2016","[('C32', 'O13'), ('C32', 'Q13'), ('C32', 'L11'), ('C32', 'D40'), ('C32', 'Q11'), ('C01', 'O13'), ('C01', 'Q13'), ('C01', 'L11'), ('C01', 'D40'), ('C01', 'Q11')]","['C32', 'O13', 'Q13', 'L11', 'D40', 'Q11', 'C01']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['O13', 'Q13', 'L11', 'D40', 'Q11']","['C32', 'C01']"

The costs of every hospital stay were estimated according to the guidelines of the Institute for the Hospital Remuneration System, an institute responsible for encoding hospital reimbursement in Germany. Cost-weight values of the year 2012 were applied for reimbursement. Related additional compensations were also included. Hospital costs ranged from 8896.26 to 193,671.94 euros per case, with a mean of 30,597 and standard deviation of 25,032 euros. Reimbursement varied from 8630.35 to 173,710.65 euros, with a mean of 25,514 and standard deviation of 18,497 euros: an underfunding of 17%. Fifty-nine per cent (271/458) of cases were classified, according to Aristotle complexity score, in higher comprehensive complexity: Levels 4–6. Costs highly correlated with complexity levels (Spearman's r coefficient = 0.89) and the regression was linear. Underfunding increased, linearly, from 6% for procedures with Level 1, lowest comprehensive complexity, to 23% for those with Level 6, highest complexity. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that reimbursement by the current German Diagnosis-Related Groups system increasingly penalises complex congenital heart surgery. Aristotle complexity score could help to correct this prejudicial situation.","2013","[('C10', 'D45'), ('C10', 'H41'), ('C10', 'I18'), ('C10', 'I11'), ('C10', 'H51'), ('C18', 'D45'), ('C18', 'H41'), ('C18', 'I18'), ('C18', 'I11'), ('C18', 'H51')]","['D45', 'H41', 'I18', 'I11', 'H51', 'C10', 'C18']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['D45', 'H41', 'I18', 'I11', 'H51']","['C10', 'C18']"

Our aim was to conduct an individualized assessment for the oral antiplatelet vorapaxar by combining trial and real‐world data to further personalize the treatment profiles. Methods Using linked UK health care databases, we developed risk prediction equations for key ischemic and bleeding events using Cox proportional hazards models. Trial hazard ratios, relative to placebo, were applied to baseline risk estimates to compute expected attributable risks, summed to derive a per‐patient net clinical benefit (NCB). High risk subgroups were defined a priori, and Gaussian mixture models (GMM) were fit to characterize the NCB distribution and identify subgroups with similar NCBs. Results NCB was consistently positive for all subgroups, likely due to the outcome correlation, and would remain positive with a 12‐fold increase in bleeding risk. GMMs identified three distinct NCB subgroups. Compared with the middle/lower NCB subgroups, those with a higher NCB tended to be older, female, and have higher CV disease burden. Conclusions Personalized B‐R assessments are feasible and clinically valuable and can be used to better predict who would benefit most from therapy.","2019","[('C93', 'I11'), ('C93', 'I12'), ('C93', 'D46'), ('C14', 'I11'), ('C14', 'I12'), ('C14', 'D46'), ('C13', 'I11'), ('C13', 'I12'), ('C13', 'D46'), ('C18', 'I11'), ('C18', 'I12'), ('C18', 'D46')]","['C93', 'C14', 'I12', 'I11', 'D46', 'C13', 'C18']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['I11', 'I12', 'D46']","['C93', 'C14', 'C13', 'C18']"

The presented analysis brings specific recommendations on the interaction between monetary policy and macroprudential regulation. The article starts with a critical analysis of the Austrian Economic School and its monetary theory of business cycle, which provides a methodological base for further empirical analysis in the paper. Based on the data of the Czech economy, the authors empirically test a hypothesis whether credits create a financial bubble when a credit growth exceeds a real GDP growth. The financial cycle had a significantly higher volatility comparing to real business cycle volatility in the Czech Republic in the period 1997-2013. The existence of the credit bubble was confirmed by statistically significant model parameters, when using the differences in relative year on year changes of banking client credits as a depended variable and relative year on year changes of real GDP as an independent variable. Currently valid European regulation doesn't allow using the same tools to host regulator and supervisor towards the bank subsidiaries and branches in a need to react to the different phases of financial cycle. If a host supervisor needs to influence and safeguard the financial stability, it has only the following tools applying to both forms of banking operations in the host countries: counter cyclical capital buffer, capital regulation of real estate exposures, and setting the loan to value (income) limits.","2015","[('B53', 'G01'), ('B53', 'G28'), ('B53', 'E52'), ('B53', 'E44'), ('B53', 'E32'), ('C32', 'G01'), ('C32', 'G28'), ('C32', 'E52'), ('C32', 'E44'), ('C32', 'E32')]","['G01', 'B53', 'C32', 'G28', 'E52', 'E44', 'E32']","False","False","True","True","True","True","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.05","['G01', 'G28', 'E52', 'E44', 'E32']","['B53', 'C32']"

Design/methodology/approach Three decision-making attributes are explored: the use of intuition vs analysis, the proclivity to heuristics, and susceptibility to bias. The intuition/analysis is tested with a questionnaire that has been validated in prior research, while information on the two other dimensions is from an exploratory survey designed for this purpose. Responses to the survey questions provide some insight into the differential decision-making style of elite NHL hockey coaches’ vis-à-vis amateur coaches and news reporters. Findings The data suggest elite decision makers have no preference for intuitive or analytical settings, but exhibit a significantly higher perception of their ability to perform in both. While current literature shows sports athletes to be more intuitive, it appears coaches excel on the analytical dimension instead. This study finds that while elite hockey coaches have fewer biases overall, they tend in particular to be overly optimistic in comparison to amateur coaches and news reporters. Research limitations/implications The main limitation in this paper is that the survey on heuristics and biases is exploratory, making these results less robust than the findings on intuition and analysis. Originality/value This paper is first to extend the decision-making literature to coaches, and among few papers that obtain insights from NHL coaches directly. The findings are likely to extend to corporate leadership as well, increasing the relevance of the results.","2017","[('C93', 'M13'), ('C93', 'M51'), ('C93', 'J24'), ('C93', 'D03'), ('C93', 'L83'), ('C83', 'M13'), ('C83', 'M51'), ('C83', 'J24'), ('C83', 'D03'), ('C83', 'L83')]","['C93', 'M13', 'M51', 'J24', 'D03', 'L83', 'C83']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['M13', 'M51', 'J24', 'L83']","['C93', 'C83']"

The explanatory variables used in the study are real effective exchange rate, broad money supply, trade openness and gross fixed capital formation. The results of the study reveal that real effective exchange rate has positive impact on the real GDP of Nepal. Based on the findings, the study concludes that the transmission mechanism of REER through aggregate demand hold in case of Nepal and this result is compatible with the traditional approach to exchange rate. Finally, it is recommended that broad money supply continues to be relevant monetary policy for Nepal. Moreover, Nepal must use the real exchange rate as one of the macroeconomic policies.

Previous studies showed that teaching hospitals (THs) more consistently use evidence-based secondary prevention therapies than non-THs (NTHs). It is unclear whether these differences persist after initiation of a national quality improvement system. Methods and Results— We analyzed 270902 patients across 361 hospitals in the Get With The Guidelines–Coronary Artery Disease program from June 2000 to September 2009. The primary outcome was guideline-concordant care, defined as compliance with all Get With The Guidelines–Coronary Artery Disease quality measures: (1) aspirin within 24 hours, (2) aspirin at discharge, (3) angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blockers for systolic dysfunction, (4) β-blockers at discharge, (5) lipid therapy if low-density lipoprotein &gt;100 mg/dL, and (6) smoking cessation. We used multivariate modeling to compare the relationship between TH and NTH status on quality measures, in-hospital mortality, and length of stay. Guideline-concordant care was higher at THs (78.4% versus 73.3%; P&lt;0.01). The adjusted odds ratio between 2000 and 2009 for guideline-concordant care at THs compared with NTHs was 2.78 (confidence interval, 1.28–6.06; P =0.01). Guideline-concordant care increased from 2000 to 2009 at THs (n=176; 65.3%→88.3%; adjusted odds ratio for year increase, 1.24 [confidence interval, 1.16–1.30; P&lt;0.01]) and NTHs (n=185; 61.0%→93.9%; adjusted odds ratio for year increase, 1.35 [confidence interval, 1.26–1.45]; P &lt;0.01). THs had shorter length of stay (adjusted odds ratio, 0.74 for length of stay &gt;4 days; confidence interval, 0.58–0.94) from 2000 to 2009. Lower in-hospital mortality was observed at THs (3.7% versus 4.4% at NTHs; P &lt;0.01), but this was not significant after adjustment. Conclusions— Adherence to guideline-recommended therapies increased over time with participation in the Get With The Guidelines–Coronary Artery Disease program, regardless of the teaching status. Guideline-concordant care over the full decade was higher in THs; however, NTHs demonstrated greater incremental improvement over time.","2012","[('C14', 'I11'), ('C14', 'H51'), ('C14', 'I12'), ('C14', 'I18'), ('C21', 'I11'), ('C21', 'H51'), ('C21', 'I12'), ('C21', 'I18'), ('C13', 'I11'), ('C13', 'H51'), ('C13', 'I12'), ('C13', 'I18')]","['C14', 'I12', 'I18', 'I11', 'H51', 'C21', 'C13']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0678872448001671","0.0784150903367164","0.1666666666666666","0.0277777777777777","","","['I11', 'H51', 'I12', 'I18']","['C14', 'C21', 'C13']"

Notion of ""bucket order"" has emerged as a popular mechanism of ranking in such settings. A bucket order is an ordered partition of the set of entities into ""buckets"". There is a total order on the buckets, but the entities within a bucket are treated as tied.In this paper, we focus on discovering bucket order from data captured in the form of user preferences. We consider two settings: one in which the discrepancies in the input preferences are ""local"" (when collected from experts) and the other in which discrepancies could be arbitrary (when collected from a large population). We present a formal model to capture the setting of local discrepancies and consider the following question: ""how many experts need to be queried to discover the underlying bucket order on n entities?"". We prove an upperbound of . In the case of arbitrary discrepancies, we model it as the bucket order problem of discovering a bucket order that best fits the data (captured as pairwise preference statistics). We present a new approach which exploits a connection between the discovery of buckets and the correlation clustering problem. We present empirical evaluation of our algorithms on real and artificially generated datasets.MSC codesrank aggregationbucket ordercorrelation clustering","2011","[('C93', 'D71'), ('C93', 'D83'), ('C61', 'D71'), ('C61', 'D83'), ('C63', 'D71'), ('C63', 'D83'), ('C44', 'D71'), ('C44', 'D83'), ('C88', 'D71'), ('C88', 'D83')]","['C93', 'C61', 'D71', 'C63', 'C44', 'D83', 'C88']","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['D71', 'D83']","['C93', 'C61', 'C63', 'C44', 'C88']"

Based on a proxy of SPV activity that can be applied to a broad cross-section of firms over time, we find a two-and-a-half fold monotonic increase in the percentage of firms using at least one SPV during the eight-year period from 1997 through 2004. Tobit regressions of the determinants of SPV use show that SPV activity increases with financial reporting incentives and economic and tax motivations, but strong corporate governance tends to mitigate their use. In addition, the evidence is consistent with SPVs arranged for financial reporting purposes being associated with earnings management, whereas the same does not appear to be the case for SPVs set up mainly for economic, tax, and other reasons.","2009","[('C13', 'G38'), ('C13', 'G32'), ('C13', 'M48'), ('C13', 'M41'), ('C13', 'K22'), ('C33', 'G38'), ('C33', 'G32'), ('C33', 'M48'), ('C33', 'M41'), ('C33', 'K22')]","['G38', 'G32', 'M41', 'K22', 'M48', 'C13', 'C33']","True","True","True","True","True","True","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['G38', 'G32', 'M48', 'M41', 'K22']","['C13', 'C33']"

To our knowledge, this literature ignores the spatial dimension of global income inequality, specifically the relationship between economic relatedness and income inequality. Using panel data for 129 countries from 1964 to 2013, we show that income inequality in a country is affected by the income inequality and economic complexity of its trading partners. We find that (1) a country's income inequality is positively correlated with the average income inequality among its top trading partners; and (2) that trade with economically more complex countries is correlated with reductions in income inequality.","2018","[('C23', 'O19'), ('C23', 'F40'), ('C23', 'E25'), ('C23', 'F10'), ('C23', 'F15'), ('C33', 'O19'), ('C33', 'F40'), ('C33', 'E25'), ('C33', 'F10'), ('C33', 'F15')]","['O19', 'F40', 'E25', 'F10', 'C23', 'F15', 'C33']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","1.0","0.0","['O19', 'F40', 'E25', 'F10', 'F15']","['C23', 'C33']"

According to our data, we found that there have been substantial improvements to the NCMS in coverage and participation. The service received by rural residents also improved in 2007. While the progress of the NCMS program is clear, there are still weaknesses. Most importantly, the program clearly does not meet its goal of providing insurance against catastrophic illnesses. On average, individuals that required inpatient treatment in 2007 were reimbursed for 15 percent of their expenditures. Although this is higher than in 2004, on average, as the severity of the illness (in terms of expenditures on health care) rose, the rate of coverage fell. The reimbursement rate for illnesses that required expenditures between 5,000 and 10,000 yuan (over 10,000 yuan) was only 11 percent (8 percent).

The stochastic frontier approach considers both the mean and variance of cost efficiency. The sample includes both stock and mutual insurers. Among the findings, the cost function of the entire sample carries the concavity feature, and insurers tend to use financial derivatives for firm value creation. The results also show that for the entire sample the use of derivatives enhances the mean of cost efficiency but accompanied with larger efficiency volatility. Nevertheless, the utilization of financial derivatives mitigates efficiency volatility for mutual insurers.

This paper reports the results of an investigation of the potential monetary benefits of allowing foods enriched with plant sterols to be marketed in Canada.The objective of this research was to estimate the annual savings that would accrue to Canada's single-payer publicly funded health care system if plant sterols were approved for use. If foods containing plant sterols are consumed at a sufficient rate, a reduction in CHD should follow. Given the significant costs associated with CHD, approval of plant sterols in Canada has important public policy implications.This research employs a variation of traditional cost-of-illness analysis entailing four steps: (1) estimation of a 'success rate' (proportion of persons who would consume plant sterols at the necessary rate); (2) presumption of blood cholesterol reduction due to plant sterol consumption; (3) assumption of reduction in CHD that follows from blood cholesterol reduction; and (4) calculation of cost savings associated with reduced incidence of CHD.CALCULATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT FOR FOUR SCENARIOS: ideal, optimistic, pessimistic, and very pessimistic. It was estimated that between $38 million (very pessimistic scenario) and $2.45 billion (ideal scenario) could be saved annually by Canada's health care system with plant sterol-enriched food products being made available for sale.Significant expenditure reductions within Canada's publicly funded health care system could be realized with plant sterols approved for sale.

In proving this result, a new approach is introduced that simplifies and unifies all the known equivalence results in the house allocation literature.

SF-12 physical component score (PCS-12) and mental component score (MCS-12) were derived using the standard US algorithm. Multilevel regression analysis (patients at level 1 and general practitioners at level 2) was applied to relate PCS-12 and MCS-12 to patient and general practitioner (GP) characteristics.Employment was likely to have a clinically significant larger positive effect on HRQoL of males (regression coefficient (B) (PCS-12) = 7.29, P < 0.001, effect size = 1.23 and B (MCS-12) = 3.40, P < 0.01, effect size = 0.55) than that of females (B(PCS-12) = 4.05, P < 0.001, effect size = 0.78 and B (MCS-12) = 1.16, P > 0.05, effect size = 0.16). There was a clinically significant difference in HRQoL among age groups. Younger men (< 39 years) were likely to have better physical health than older men (> 59 years, B = -5.82, P < 0.05, effect size = 0.66); older women tended to have better mental health (B = 5.62, P < 0.001, effect size = 0.77) than younger women. Chronically-ill women smokers reported clinically significant (B = -3.99, P < 0.001, effect size = 0.66) poorer mental health than women who were non-smokers. Female GPs were more likely to examine female patients than male patients (33% vs. 15%, P < 0.001) and female patients attending female GPs reported better physical health (B = 1.59, P < 0.05, effect size = 0.30).Some of the associations between patient characteristics and SF-12 physical and/or mental component scores were different for men and women. This finding underlines the importance of considering these factors in the management of chronically-ill patients in general practice. The results suggest that chronically ill women attempting to quit smoking may need more psychological support. More quantitative studies are needed to determine the association between GP gender and patient gender in relation to HRQoL.","2013","[('C21', 'J14'), ('C21', 'I12'), ('C21', 'I18'), ('C21', 'J16'), ('C21', 'H51'), ('C13', 'J14'), ('C13', 'I12'), ('C13', 'I18'), ('C13', 'J16'), ('C13', 'H51')]","['J14', 'I12', 'I18', 'J16', 'H51', 'C21', 'C13']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0114591291061879","0.0324929971988795","0.0","0.0","","","['J14', 'I12', 'I18', 'J16', 'H51']","['C21', 'C13']"

In spite of its ubiquity, empirical studies of growth are often limited to private activities and specific sectors, and generative models on the other hand are built on simplified assumptions and only aim at reproducing stylized facts. In this study, we use a unique Swedish longitudinal database on employment in the Stockholm Region, to analyze the interplay between organizational growth statistics by ownership sector, industrial activity and inter-organizational employee movements during a period of 14 years. We fit distributions for organizational size and growth rates. We find that the body of the aggregate growth-rate distribution is dominated by public sector growth, while the private sector dominates the tails. Industries with mostly public organizations tend to have a lognormal size distribution, while privately-owned industries are better fitted by a truncated power law. Growth-rate distributions are fitted to an exponential power (Subbotin) distribution. We decompose the change in size into incoming and outgoing employee movements, and find that the distribution of aggregated movements is well approximated by a lognormal distribution. Most organizations that do not grow have however in- and outgoing movements, but these mostly cancel each other out.","2018","[('C10', 'J60'), ('C10', 'L20'), ('C10', 'R10'), ('C10', 'O40'), ('C10', 'M10'), ('C40', 'J60'), ('C40', 'L20'), ('C40', 'R10'), ('C40', 'O40'), ('C40', 'M10')]","['J60', 'L20', 'R10', 'O40', 'C10', 'C40', 'M10']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.5","0.0","['J60', 'L20', 'R10', 'O40', 'M10']","['C10', 'C40']"

In addition, the joint predictive density can be used to construct simple statistics to evaluate the local internal consistency of a forecasting exercise of a system of variables. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that these simultaneous confidence regions provide approximately correct coverage in situations where traditional error bands, based on the collection of marginal predictive densities for each horizon, are vastly off the mark.

The core ingredients of change have been, in different proportions and timing across countries: privatization of formerly state-owned enterprises, unbundling of networks, market liberalization and regulation. This paper summarizes some empirical findings of a team of researchers at the University of Milan about the impact of the reforms on energy prices (1990-2007) for EU-15 households. Econometric testing of the impact of the reforms (measured by OECD/ECTR scores) on prices of electricity and gas finds that public ownership of the incumbents is correlated with lower prices for households; unbundling per se has no statistically significant effect; the evidence about liberalization is mixed. Price inertia, sources of primary energy in electricity, and oil price in gas are still the core price determinants. Customers' satisfaction with prices confirms these findings. There is some evidence that consumers are subjectively happy with the opportunity to switch their electricity supplier, even if the objective evidence about the actual benefit of doing this is limited.","2013","[('C21', 'H23'), ('C21', 'L52'), ('C21', 'Q48'), ('C21', 'D43'), ('C21', 'L95'), ('C13', 'H23'), ('C13', 'L52'), ('C13', 'Q48'), ('C13', 'D43'), ('C13', 'L95')]","['H23', 'L52', 'Q48', 'D43', 'L95', 'C21', 'C13']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0333333333333333","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.5","['H23', 'L52', 'Q48', 'D43', 'L95']","['C21', 'C13']"

Secondly, contrary to previous works, we distinguish many types of financial reforms. We found that equity market liberalization is the most important component in reducing economical costs associated with financial crisis. Thus, equity market liberalization is the most important favoring growth.

The research is based on the hypothesis that countries with greater macroeconomic stability achieve greater social progress. The integrated index of human capital is proposed as a target for the construction of an appropriate system for monitoring social progress, and in the future – identifying the impact on macroeconomic stability. The main stages of estimating the integral index of human capital are: identification of relevant indicators that will form each of the sub-indices; filtering the selected indicators in the previous stage based on the analysis of the correlation matrix of each of the subindices; normalization of indicators in each of the subindices, calculation of the integral index for each of the subindices, calculation of the final integral index of human capital. The calculations of the integrated capital human capital index for some of the EU countries (Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Croatia, Romania) and Ukraine for the period 2000–2015 allowed us to conclude that Romania and Ukraine were on a marginal level of social progress, while Lithuania, Poland and Croatia in the range of moderate level. The use of the OLS (the least squares) method to determine the significance of changes in social progress to macroeconomic stability has revealed a positive and statistically significant impact of social progress on macroeconomic stability.","2018","[('C43', 'F45'), ('C43', 'E60'), ('C43', 'I31'), ('C43', 'O40'), ('C43', 'E02'), ('C38', 'F45'), ('C38', 'E60'), ('C38', 'I31'), ('C38', 'O40'), ('C38', 'E02')]","['F45', 'E60', 'I31', 'O40', 'E02', 'C38', 'C43']","True","True","False","False","False","False","0.25","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['F45', 'E60', 'I31', 'O40', 'E02']","['C43', 'C38']"

About 30 years ago researchers began publishing evidence of systematic deviations from uncovered interest parity or, equivalently, of forward exchange rate bias. This raised an immediate set of questions. The first questions involved whether those results were a quirk of the sample period or the statistical tests employed. Over time it became apparent that the results were, in fact, robust. The more thorny questions involved what to make of the results. To what extent were the apparent deviations from uncovered interest parity or the corresponding apparent profits from the carry trade (which attempts to exploit deviations from uncovered interest parity by borrowing in low interest rate currencies and lending in high interest rate currencies) due to the absence or underrepresentation in the sample of large adverse events—the so-called peso problem—and to what extent were they real? And to the extent that they were real, did they reflect compensation for bearing risk or mispricing (inefficiency), or both? Those questions have proven to be perennial as well as thorny. Two surveys of this literature, Hodrick (1987) and Engel (1996), stand up extremely well to rereading today and contain excellent analytical descriptions of the accumulating evidence in the 10 or 15 years after the first evidence of a systematic forward bias emerged from the literature. Engel’s concluding paragraph (1996, 183) provides a summary of the state of knowledge at the time: “Progress in any scientific field is usually made in small increments. While Hodrick’s (1987) conclusion—‘We do not yet have a model of expected returns that fits the data’—is equally applicable today, progress has been made. What we have learned since 1987 is that many simple explanations for the forward exchange rate bias do not work. We have ruled many things out, but have not yet settled on the ‘true’ story.” Perhaps unfortunately, his conclusion could easily have been written a dozen years later.Although it remains true that we “have not yet settled on the ‘true’ story,” this paper, along with its companion, Jordà and Taylor (2009), has given us a few considerable “increments”—both methodological and substantive. The authors develop and implement utility-based methods to evaluate forecasts that I expect will be of considerable value to others. In addition, these papers advance our understanding of both the role of peso problems in the dynamics of the returns to the carry trade and the role of risk factors in accounting for average carry trade returns.One conclusion that I believe emerges from this paper and from Jordà and Taylor (2009) is that the peso problem is an important component of the dynamics of returns to the carry trade. That is not to say that the peso problem can fully account for those returns—these papers suggest that it decidedly does not.1 Indeed, the focus of both papers is on examining trading strategies that incorporate carry trade features but do not exhibit peso-problem dynamics.Brunnermeier, Nagel, and Pedersen (2008) show that relatively infrequent and sudden depreciations of high interest rate currencies are a fundamental feature of exchange rate dynamics—that is, exchange rates exhibit conditional skewness.2 Indeed, they argue that these crashes of high interest rate currencies reflect an endogenous response as traders in a market in which the carry trade is prevalent encounter funding (liquidity) constraints and need to unwind carry positions.Conditional skewness is apparent in the returns to a naive carry strategy in both this paper and in its companion, Jordà and Taylor (2009). Quite sensibly, the authors consider more sophisticated trading strategies that do not suffer from negative skewness (crash dynamics). A problem with naive carry strategies is that as the likelihood of a crash increases, interest differential rises, and carry trades appear to be more profitable. The main goal of a more sophisticated strategy is to identify signals strong enough to override the widening interest differential and lead the trader to close out the trade before a crash occurs.In both papers, the more sophisticated strategy is based on directional signals derived from exchange rate forecasts based on lagged interest differentials, lagged exchange rate changes, and lagged inflation differentials in a vector error correction model with the cointegrating vector arising due to stationary real exchange rate dynamics. In both papers, the VECM-based trading strategy eliminates the negative skewness from the strategy’s profits. In Jordà and Taylor (2009), the VECM is augmented by dividing the sample according to the distance between the real exchange rate and its long run value and the size of the interest differential, and in this paper it is augmented with yield curve factors. In both papers, the performance of the trading profits generated by the directional signals of the augmented VECMs is considerably better than those generated by the VECMs.The obvious question is, why—what is it about the VECM-based forecasts and, especially, the augmented VECM-based forecasts that leads them to overcome the influence of the interest differential and greatly reduce the likelihood of being caught in a crash? Presumably, the basic VECM results in a greater likelihood of a timely exit because crashes are more likely when real exchange rates are farther from their long run or average values. If the stationary dynamics imposed by the VECM then outweigh the influence of the interest differential on the exchange rate forecasts when real exchange rate deviations are large, the resulting directional forecasts will leave the trader more likely to close out a trade before a crash occurs. Although this is a plausible explanation, it would be nice to have it nailed down more explicitly. A seemingly more important source of the greater ability of these trades to avoid crashes is the presence of the lagged exchange rate in the regressions—referred to by the authors as a momentum factor. This is somewhat of a puzzle—including only a single lag of the exchange rate generates forecasts that notably improve trade performance.What is it about the augmented VECMs that causes them to generate even more timely directional forecasts? When Jordà and Taylor (2009) divide the sample by the size of the deviation of the real exchange rate from its long run value and the size of the interest differential, they find that when both are large, the coefficient on the interest differential changes sign, so that the interest differential reinforces (rather than offsets) the real exchange rate in generating forecasts and will lead to greater likelihood of a timely exit.3 I suspect that this result may relate to the results in Clarida, Davis, and Pedersen (2009), who find that the coefficient on the interest differential changes sign when the “Fama regression” is estimated over periods of high exchange rate volatility. If my suspicions are correct, volatility is likely to be high when both interest differentials and deviations of real exchange rates from their long run value are high.In the current paper, the Nelson and Siegel (1987) level, slope, and curvature yield curve factors—more precisely the level, slope, and curvature factors for the yield curve differentials—are added to the VECM, resulting in more timely directional forecasts. Again, insight into why including the yield curve factors leads to more timely directional forecasts might be found in Clarida et al. (2009). When they regress carry trade returns on relative yield curve level and slope factors, they find that the level factor is positively correlated with carry trade returns and the slope factor is negatively correlated with carry trade returns. By including the slope and curvature factors in the augmented VECM, the authors are able to improve the directional forecasts—when the slope (and, possibly the curvature) is unusually high, lower carry trade returns are predicted and the directional signals obtained from the augmented VECM are more likely to lead to a timely exit.That the returns from the more sophisticated trading strategies explored by the authors do not exhibit negative conditional skewness and are profitable on average suggest that peso problems do not fully account for carry trade profits. This raises the question of whether any profits arising from either the naive or sophisticated carry trade strategies reflect compensation for the risk associated with those trading strategies.The authors are to be commended for considering returns based on rolling out-of-sample directional forecasts. This choice undoubtedly affects their results, especially because it includes the recent financial crisis, a period that was extremely unfavorable for carry trades. If fact, one might suspect that their evaluation period might overweight the kind of infrequent but large “crashes” that reduce carry trade returns. Average returns from the naive carry trades are indeed negative (as well as negatively skewed) over their evaluation period when the authors consider an equally weighted basket of currencies. In contrast, the average returns to the trading strategies based on the VECM and augmented VECM estimates are positive.Are the positive returns to the equally weighted portfolios compensation for risk? At a casual level, other recent work suggests that risk premia associated with naive carry trade returns may be significant. Brunnermeier et al. (2008) and Clarida et al. (2009) find that carry trade losses tend to arise in periods of high volatility. And if Brunnermeier et al. correctly attribute these periods to ones in which trades encounter liquidity problems, carry trade losses arise just when the value of funds is greatest and when risk premia are likely to be high.The authors provide a great deal of insight by regressing returns from both naive carry trades and more sophisticated strategies on several risk factors considered in the literature. More precisely, they regress the returns to equally weighted portfolios on 11 different risk factors, one at a time. The results are a bit mixed.The risk factors appear to be important, as the intuition would suggest, in explaining the returns to naive carry trades. Eight of the 11 risk factors are significant at conventional levels when the returns from a naive carry strategy are considered. And when the naive carry strategy is augmented with the yield curve factors, five of the 11 risk factors are significant at conventional levels. The intercepts—the estimates of risk-adjusted rates of return—on the other hand, are significant at the 90% level for only one of the risk factor regressions with the naive carry trade returns (and that intercept is significantly negative). This rises to three with the carry+ returns.When the VECM-based directional forecasts are used, the authors find significant coefficients on five of the 11 risk factors. And when the returns are computed from the directional forecasts derived from the VECM with the yield curve factors included, the authors find that none of the risk factors are significant in their regressions. This leads them to be skeptical that the returns to these more sophisticated trading strategies are, in fact, compensation for risk. But in those same regressions, none of the intercepts, which are estimates of the average risk adjust return, are significant at conventional levels. When the VECM-based directional forecasts are used, the average t-ratio on the intercepts is 1.0. The average t-ratio rises to 1.5 when the VECM+-based forecasts are used. At first blush, an average t-ratio of 1.5 appears worthy of note, but these intercept estimates are far from independent—they are all essentially slightly different estimates of the sample mean of the same series.What should one make of these results? One possibility is that the relatively small sample size has led to imprecise estimates of the slopes and/or the intercepts. Another is that the authors have taken what is learned from the risk factors that help explain returns to naive carry strategies to create more sophisticated trading strategies that generate returns uncorrelated with the risk factors.How might clearer results be obtained? I have two suggestions. First, the authors might consider alternatives to equally weighting the portfolios. Perhaps a portfolio constructed in the spirit of Treynor and Black (1973), in which the portfolio’s weight for each currency depends on the alpha for that currency relative to the variance of the idiosyncratic part of the return, would be interesting. Or portfolios chosen to maximize the Sharpe ratio might be considered.4 Second, the authors might consider multiple risk factors in a regression rather than regressions with one risk factor at a time. In particular, it might be interesting to combine equity market risk (either the CAPM or Fama and French factors), a liquidity premium (the TED spread), and one or more volatility measures.Notes1. Burnside et al. (2008) use options strategies and find that the peso problem cannot explain carry trade profits in their sample, which ends in January 2008. Jurek (2009) also uses currency options data to examine carry trade returns.2. They note that these dynamics are consistent with a common expression among traders that currencies “go up the stairs and down the elevator,” at least for high interest rate currencies.3. Flood and Taylor (1996) and others have also found that the sign of the interest differential in the standard “Fama regression” changes when the sample is segmented by the size of the interest differential.4. These alternatives may not improve portfolio performance, however. DeMiguel, Garlappi, and Uppal (2009) find that estimation error can lead equity portfolios constructed with more sophisticated methods to underperform equally weighted portfolios.ReferencesBrunnermeier, Markus K., Stefan Nagel, and Lasse Pedersen. 2008. “Carry Trades and Currency Crashes.” Working Paper 14473 (November), NBER, Cambridge, MA.First citation in articleGoogle ScholarBurnside, A.

Its rejection within the leftist tradition, both by some philosophers as well as economists, is a part of a broader phenomenon called a “crisis of Marxism”. In result, a philosophically oriented part of Marxist theory, trying to free Marxism from defects of “economism”, also cutting it off from the benefits that may flow from the adoption of theoretical economics perspective. While some economic Marxists, in order to free the Marxist political economy from the shortcomings inherent in LTV also cut it off from the special status attributed to the notion of labour. Although later, LTV get acquitted from the charge of alleged logical contradiction, it was only in order to condemn it for oblivion for its alleged redundancy. In this article we will discuss the specifics of the Marxian version of LTV. The introduction gives four qualitative assumptions which, according to the author, determine the character of the Marxian version of the LTV. The first part outlines place that LTV holds in the history of economic thought. The second part focuses on the fate of the Marxian version of the LTV under the very Marxist tradition. The third part discusses the problem of value and its measurement. The fourth part is devoted to the analysis of the problem of labour and selection of the unit of its measurement, as well as tries to reconstruct Marx's theory of reproduction of employees through labour.

Investors look for reassuring signals or tell-tale signs around uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach Variation in the market response to announcements of S&amp;P additions to the 400, 500 and 600 indices is examined against measures of risk factors. Internal risk factors include firm size relative to the index, total firm risk and liquidity, and whether the firm is a brand new index entrant. External risk factors related to market uncertainty are measured by the Chicago Board of Exchange volatility index. Findings Firms with lower market capitalization relative to the index, higher total risk, lower trading volume and first-time entrants to any S&amp;P index elicit a positive market reaction compared to firms with less pricing uncertainty. In times of increased market uncertainty, investors tend to place more value on signals from respected institutions such as S&amp;P, and riskier firms benefit more from inclusion in the S&amp;P index. Overall, this study finds that the market overreaction is explained by the degree of uncertainty surrounding the added firms, as well as by the degree of market uncertainty at the time of the announcement. Originality/value The findings of this study suggest that investors interpret the prospect of S&amp;P index addition as an opportunity for firms to reduce uncertainty surrounding them, and thus partially hedge their exposure to market uncertainty by joining an index tracked by dozens of index funds. The value of such a hedging strategy rises for riskier firms during market turbulence.","2018","[('C22', 'G14'), ('C22', 'G30'), ('C22', 'G01'), ('C22', 'G20'), ('C22', 'D81'), ('C12', 'G14'), ('C12', 'G30'), ('C12', 'G01'), ('C12', 'G20'), ('C12', 'D81')]","['G14', 'C22', 'G30', 'C12', 'G01', 'G20', 'D81']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['G14', 'G30', 'G01', 'G20', 'D81']","['C22', 'C12']"

Probit models with a two‐step Heckman selection procedure are applied to identify the determinants of the likelihood and degree of food safety violations. Market power is found to reduce the likelihood of violation but not the degree of violation. Other factors such as traceability systems, adoption of risk control systems and industry standards, and the scale and scope of operations also impact food safety violations. Findings suggest that market power in China’s pork industry provides incentives for firms to mitigate risk and improve food safety. However, firms may continue to have challenges in meeting food safety obligations when moving toward mega‐size and product diversification.","2018","[('C25', 'M21'), ('C25', 'Q13'), ('C25', 'D43'), ('C25', 'Q18'), ('C25', 'L13'), ('C13', 'M21'), ('C13', 'Q13'), ('C13', 'D43'), ('C13', 'Q18'), ('C13', 'L13')]","['L13', 'M21', 'Q13', 'C25', 'D43', 'Q18', 'C13']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0415547415547415","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['M21', 'Q13', 'D43', 'Q18', 'L13']","['C25', 'C13']"

Given the current mode, this model allows for either a switch to the other mode or termination of the project, and this happens for both sides of the balance sheet. A novelty in this model is that the related obstacles are nonlinear in the underlying yields, whereas, they are linear in the standard optimal switching problem. The optimal switching problem is formulated in terms of a system of Snell envelopes for the profit and cost yields which act as obstacles to each other.

Design Comparison of audit data items collected nationally in a designed audit of inflammatory bowel disease (UK IBD audit) with routinely collected inpatient data; surveys of audit sites to compare costs. Setting National Health Service hospitals across England, Wales and Northern Ireland that participated in the UK IBD audit. Patients Patients in the UK IBD audit. Interventions None. Main outcome measures Percentage agreement between designed audit data items collected for the UK IBD audit and routine inpatient data items; costs of conducting the designed UK IBD audit and the routine data audit. Results There were very high matching rates between the designed audit data and routine data for a small subset of basic important information collected in the UK IBD audit, including mortality; major surgery; dates of admission, surgery, discharge and death; principal diagnoses; and sociodemographic patient characteristics. There were lower matching rates for other items, including source of admission, primary reason for admission, most comorbidities, colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. Routine data did not cover most detailed information collected in the UK IBD audit. Using routine data was much less costly than collecting designed audit data. Conclusion Although valuable for large population-based studies, and less costly than designed data, routine inpatient data are not suitable for the evaluation of individual patient care within a designed audit.","2011","[('C93', 'H51'), ('C93', 'I12'), ('C93', 'H41'), ('C93', 'I18'), ('C81', 'H51'), ('C81', 'I12'), ('C81', 'H41'), ('C81', 'I18'), ('C83', 'H51'), ('C83', 'I12'), ('C83', 'H41'), ('C83', 'I18')]","['C93', 'H41', 'I12', 'I18', 'H51', 'C81', 'C83']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.08","0.125","0.0","0.0","","","['H51', 'I12', 'H41', 'I18']","['C93', 'C81', 'C83']"

We apply Kelejian’s FE-2SLS procedure to a higher-order spatial autoregressive model and estimate the spatial dependence of firm-level TFP within and across regional borders. The model demonstrates positive and significant intra-regional technological spillovers among firms. It also provides direct evidence that technological spillovers attenuate rapidly in spatial distance. We find that firm productivity benefits from own R&amp;D and export activities, employment density, market competition and public expenditure. Further analyses show that the strength of spillover effects is affected by a broad range of factors, including the surface area of the region, administration type, border effect, transport and ICT infrastructure, FDI intensity, the financial sector, the utility service sector, and human capital. Factors that facilitate long-distance economic connections in general make inter-regional spillovers stronger but intra-regional spillovers weaker.","2017","[('C21', 'R11'), ('C21', 'R12'), ('C21', 'L60'), ('C21', 'O31'), ('C21', 'D24'), ('C13', 'R11'), ('C13', 'R12'), ('C13', 'L60'), ('C13', 'O31'), ('C13', 'D24')]","['R11', 'R12', 'L60', 'O31', 'D24', 'C21', 'C13']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.25","['R11', 'R12', 'L60', 'O31', 'D24']","['C21', 'C13']"

A cross-sectional study in Kisumu, Kenya","Rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAs) are highly active in many sub-Saharan African countries, serving as an important gateway for coping with financial risk. In light of the Kenya's National Hospital Insurance Fund's (NHIF's) strategy of targeting ROSCAs for membership enrolment, this study sought to estimate how ROSCA membership influences the determinants of voluntary health insurance enrolment. A cross-sectional survey of 444 households was carried out in Kisumu City between July and August 2016. A structured questionnaire was administered on health insurance membership, household attributes, headship characteristics and health-seeking behaviour. We assessed the influence of ROSCA membership on the associations between NHIF enrolment and the explanatory variables using univariate logistic regression. The study found that education was associated with NHIF demand regardless of ROSCA membership. Both ROSCA and non-ROSCA households with high socioeconomic status showed stronger health insurance demand compared with poorer households; there was, however, no evidence that the strength of this association was influenced by ROSCA status (p-value = 0.47). Participants who were self-employed were significantly less likely to enrol into the NHIF if they did not belong to a ROSCA (interaction test p-value = 0.03). NHIF enrolment was found to be lower among female-headed households. There was a borderline effect of ROSCA membership on this association, with a lower odds ratio amongst non-ROSCA members (p-value = 0.09): the low treatment numbers amongst the insured infers that ROSCA membership may play a role on the association between gender and NHIF demand. Our findings suggest that ROSCA membership may play a role in increasing health insurance demand amongst some traditionally under-represented groups such as women and the self-employed. However, the strategy of targeting ROSCAs to increase national health insurance enrolment may yield exiguous results, given that ROSCA membership is itself influenced by several non-observable factors – such as time-availability and self-selection. It is therefore important to anchor outreach to ROSCAs within a broader, multi-pronged approach that targets households within their social, economic and political realities.","2018","[('C25', 'O16'), ('C25', 'G22'), ('C25', 'D12'), ('C25', 'I12'), ('C25', 'I13'), ('C93', 'O16'), ('C93', 'G22'), ('C93', 'D12'), ('C93', 'I12'), ('C93', 'I13')]","['C93', 'G22', 'O16', 'D12', 'I12', 'C25', 'I13']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['O16', 'G22', 'D12', 'I12', 'I13']","['C25', 'C93']"

Should the option holder believe the true drift of the stock price to be unfavorable (based upon the observed price movements), he can substitute the true drift with the contract drift and minimize his losses. The practical implications of this protection feature are most remarkable, as not only is the option holder afforded a unique protection against unfavorable stock price movements (covering the ability to sell in a liquid option market completely endogenously), but also when the stock price movements are favorable he will generally receive high returns. We derive a closed form expression for the arbitrage-free price in terms of the rational exercise boundary and show that the rational exercise boundary itself can be characterized as the unique solution to a nonlinear integral equation. Using these results we perform a financial analysis of the British Asian option that leads to the conclusions above and shows that with the contract drift properly selected the British Asian option becomes a very attractive alternative to the classic (European) Asian option.","2010","[('C61', 'G13'), ('C61', 'D53'), ('C61', 'G11'), ('C61', 'G12'), ('C02', 'G13'), ('C02', 'D53'), ('C02', 'G11'), ('C02', 'G12'), ('C63', 'G13'), ('C63', 'D53'), ('C63', 'G11'), ('C63', 'G12')]","['C61', 'G11', 'C63', 'G13', 'D53', 'C02', 'G12']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0269841269841269","0.0","0.1","0.0","0.0","0.0","['G13', 'D53', 'G11', 'G12']","['C61', 'C02', 'C63']"

Evaluation of utilities for PD and their correlation with standard rating scales have been limited.Utilities were generated using the Health Utilities Index Mark III (HUI-III) on consecutive patients attending a PD Clinic between October 2003 and June 2006. Disease severity, medical, surgical (subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS)), and demographic information were used as model covariates. Predictors of HUI-III utility scores were evaluated using the Wilxocon rank-sum test and linear regression models.68 men with a diagnosis of PD and a mean age of 74.0 (SD 7.4) were included in the data analysis. Mean HUI-III utility at first visit was 0.45 (SD 0.33). In multivariable models, UPDRS-II score (r2 = 0.56, P < 0.001) was highly predictive of HRQoL. UPDRS-III was a weaker, but still significant, predictor of utility scores, even after adjustment for UPDRS-II (P = 0.01).Poor self-care in PD reflected by worsening UPDRS-II scores is strongly correlated with low generic HRQoL. HUI-III-based health utilities display convergent validity with the UPDRS-II. These findings highlight the importance of measures of independence as determinants of HRQoL in PD, and will facilitate the utilization of existing UPDRS data into economic analyses of PD therapies.","2010","[('C30', 'H51'), ('C30', 'J14'), ('C30', 'I12'), ('C30', 'I10'), ('C10', 'H51'), ('C10', 'J14'), ('C10', 'I12'), ('C10', 'I10'), ('C40', 'H51'), ('C40', 'J14'), ('C40', 'I12'), ('C40', 'I10')]","['I10', 'J14', 'I12', 'H51', 'C30', 'C10', 'C40']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.3495904940923738","0.2020089285714285","0.0","0.0","0.0714285714285714","0.0","['H51', 'J14', 'I12', 'I10']","['C30', 'C10', 'C40']"

Pseudo-panel data are constructed from nine repeated cross sections of Sri Lanka's Labor Force Survey data from 1997 to 2008, for workers born during 1953–1974. The results show that for males, one extra year of education increases monthly earnings by about 5% using the pseudo-panel estimation rather than 9% as in the ordinary least-squares (OLS) estimation. This indicates that not controlling for unobservables such as ability and motivation biases the OLS estimation of returns upwards by about 4% on average, driven mainly by what happens in urban areas. It also suggests that males with higher ability seem to be acquiring more years of education. This is contrary to what has been observed recently in countries such as Thailand [Warunsiri, S., and R.

The clinical management of prostate cancer has been outlined, yet is not intended to describe quality prostate cancer care. Therefore, RAND researchers developed quality indicators for early stage prostate cancer. The ACoS (American College of Surgeons) used these indicators to perform the first national assessment to our knowledge of the quality of care among men with early stage prostate cancer undergoing expectant management.Information from medical records was abstracted for evidence of compliance with the RAND indicators (structure and process). Weighted and stratified proportions were calculated to assess indicator compliance. Logistic regression models were fit and evaluated by hospital type and patient factors.A weighted and stratified total of 13,876 early stage prostate cancer cases on expectant management in 2000 to 2001 were investigated. Compliance with structural indicators was high (greater than 80%) and compliance with process indicators varied (19% to 87%). Differences in process indicators were observed from models by hospital type and comorbid conditions, but not for age, race or insurance status.Using the RAND quality indicators this study revealed several process areas for quality improvement among men with early stage prostate cancer on expectant management in the United States. Efforts to improve the quality of early stage prostate cancer care need to move beyond the paradigm of age, race and insurance status.","2012","[('C21', 'H41'), ('C21', 'I14'), ('C21', 'I18'), ('C21', 'I11'), ('C21', 'H51'), ('C13', 'H41'), ('C13', 'I14'), ('C13', 'I18'), ('C13', 'I11'), ('C13', 'H51')]","['H41', 'I14', 'I18', 'I11', 'H51', 'C21', 'C13']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0774545446464293","0.1138425559947299","0.0","0.0","","","['H41', 'I14', 'I18', 'I11', 'H51']","['C21', 'C13']"

In the backdrop of a high burden of Non-Communicable Diseases and Injuries (NCDI) in India, and a paucity of estimates on government spending on NCDI, this paper attempts to analyse public sector expenditure on NCDI spending in India. Methods Various recent budget documents of the Centre and States/Union Territories have been used to extract expenditure on NCDI. The aggregates thus arrived at have been analysed to estimate aggregate and state level per capita spending. State level spending have been compared against disease burden using DALYs. Patterns of spending on NCDI across states were also analysed together with state level poverty to observe possible patterns. Findings The total spending on NCDI by the government is low at less than 0.5% of GDP. NCDI spending is little more than one-fourth of total health spending of the country and most spending takes place at the state level (80%). The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's share in Central spending on NCDI is around 65%, and currently it spends 20% of its total health spending on NCDI. The gap between spending and DALYs is the most for the economically vulnerable states. Also, the states with high poverty levels also have low per capita expenditure on NCDI Interpretation India does not depend on donor funding for health. It will have to step up domestic funding to address the increasing disease burden of NCDIs and to reduce the high out-of-pocket expenditure on NCDI. Policies on NCDI need to focus on UHC, service integration and personnel gaps.","2019","[('C43', 'O15'), ('C43', 'H54'), ('C43', 'I12'), ('C43', 'I18'), ('C43', 'H51'), ('C80', 'O15'), ('C80', 'H54'), ('C80', 'I12'), ('C80', 'I18'), ('C80', 'H51')]","['H54', 'O15', 'C80', 'I12', 'I18', 'H51', 'C43']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['O15', 'H54', 'I12', 'I18', 'H51']","['C43', 'C80']"

However, GAS has not been validated adequately in an RCT setting. In this paper we propose a conceptual validation plan of GAS in the setting of rare disease drug trials, and describe a hypothetical trial where GAS could be validated. Methods We have used the COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) taxonomy to deduce which measurement properties of GAS can be evaluated, and how. As individual GAS scores cannot be interpreted outside the context of a RCT, the validation of GAS needs to be done on trial as well as on individual level. Results The procedure of GAS consists of three steps. For the step of goal selection (step 1) and definition of levels of attainment (step 2), face validity may be assessed by clinical experts. For the evaluation of the goal attainment (step 3), the inter and intra rater reliability can be evaluated on an individual level. Construct validity may be evaluated by comparison with change scores on other instruments measuring in the same domain as particular goals, if available, and by testing hypotheses about differences between groups. A difference in mean GAS scores between a group who received an efficacious intervention and a control group is an indication of well-chosen goals, and corroborates construct validity of GAS on trial level. Responsiveness of GAS cannot be evaluated due to the nature of the construct being assessed. Conclusion GAS may be useful as an instrument to assess functional change as an outcome measure in heterogeneous chronic rare diseases, but it can only be interpreted and validated when used in RCTs with blinded outcome assessment. This proposed theoretical validation plan can be used as a starting point to validate GAS in specific conditions.","2019","[('C93', 'I91'), ('C93', 'I10'), ('C93', 'I19'), ('C19', 'I91'), ('C19', 'I10'), ('C19', 'I19'), ('C99', 'I91'), ('C99', 'I10'), ('C99', 'I19'), ('C18', 'I91'), ('C18', 'I10'), ('C18', 'I19')]","['I91', 'C93', 'I10', 'I19', 'C19', 'C99', 'C18']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['I10', 'I19']","['C93', 'C19', 'C99', 'C18']"

Recent econometric studies point to three results: (i) NTM restrictiveness measures based on an aggregate of 'core' NTMs are more restrictive than existing tariffs and, because of export composition towards agricultural products, in the aggregate, these 'core' NTMs limit market access most for low-income countries; (ii) Proxies for individual NTMs have a negative effect on the volume of bilateral trade for the detailed product under scrutiny; (iii) harmonization of standards is trade enhancing. Case studies confirm several of these patterns, and also that perceived severity of NTMs varies across products and across destinations for a given product. Across broadly defined imports at the section level, NTMs are more restrictive than the corresponding tariffs with two-thirds of the ad-valorem equivalent estimates in the 25%-50% range.

In 1663 the Swedish state signed a lease contract for the management of the kingdom's postal service, handing over the leadership of the post to the nobleman Johan von Beijer. The purpose of this article is to show how the early modern Swedish state used private alternatives in executing its undertakings. An analysis of Johan von Beijer's lease contract will serve as an illuminating example of what such a private alternative might be. In order to answer the question of what influenced the choice of organization form, transaction cost theory is applied. Based on the analysis of the contract, and the negotiations between Beijer and the state, this article is able to complement and show the nuances of how the early modern Swedish state functioned in practice.

The study analyzes the relationship between skill-and-technology intensive manufacturing industry exportation and economic growth based on variables such as human capital and institutional quality. In demonstrating the difference between the growth rates of the countries in question (and in examining the role of skill-and-technology-intensive export), the Li-Racine (2004) Generalized Kernel Estimation Method has been used. The for-eign trade goods categorized according to their technological intensity in the paper were classified in ac-cordance with the United Nations Comtrade Harmonized System (4-digit). The last 11 countries of the G-20 in terms of foreign trade volume are the following: Turkey, Italy, India, Mexico, Indonesia, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Southern Korea, and Russia. The analysis covers the time period of 1995-2010. The results of non-parametric analysis methods reveal, just as parametric analysis results do, that there exists a positive and meaningful relationship between economic growth and the export of skill-and-technology-intensive goods for most countries.","2015","[('C14', 'E23'), ('C14', 'F43'), ('C14', 'F14'), ('C14', 'O40'), ('C14', 'F10'), ('C21', 'E23'), ('C21', 'F43'), ('C21', 'F14'), ('C21', 'O40'), ('C21', 'F10')]","['E23', 'C14', 'F43', 'F14', 'O40', 'F10', 'C21']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['E23', 'F43', 'F14', 'O40', 'F10']","['C14', 'C21']"

In this context, Bai and Ng ( Journal of Econometrics 2008; 146 : 304–317) find an improvement in selecting indicators according to the forecast variable prior to factor estimation ( targeted predictors ). In particular, they propose using the LARS‐EN algorithm to remove irrelevant predictors. In this paper, we adapt the Bai and Ng procedure to a setup in which data releases are delayed and staggered. In the pre‐selection step, we replace actual data with estimates obtained on the basis of past information, where the structure of the available information replicates the one a forecaster would face in real time. We estimate on the reduced dataset the dynamic factor model of Giannone et al. ( Journal of Monetary Economics 2008; 55 : 665–676) and Doz et al. ( Journal of Econometrics 2011; 164 : 188–205), which is particularly suitable for the very short‐term forecast of GDP. A pseudo real‐time evaluation on French data shows the potential of our approach.

These processes can vary in complexity and size involving various resource requirements and time constraints. However, SimFC is also a versatile general purpose simulator which allows users to easily model almost all entity-relationship based systems using the elements provided in the visual environment. On the other hand, planning for airport human resources is often a challenging task especially when factors such as airplane delays, passenger check-ins, luggage inspections and passenger wait time policies are considered. This paper discusses a simulation model of passenger check-ins and security checkpoints at the Calgary International Airport using SimFC. A simple case study of US bound passengers from Calgary is presented. Based on passenger throughput levels and traffic intensity, airport-level human resource allocation recommendations for the number of check-in agents and passenger facing security personnel are made. The findings are of particular interest to researchers and industry professionals involved in airport service planning and management.","2012","[('C53', 'L93'), ('C53', 'J23'), ('C53', 'R41'), ('C53', 'M11'), ('C61', 'L93'), ('C61', 'J23'), ('C61', 'R41'), ('C61', 'M11'), ('C88', 'L93'), ('C88', 'J23'), ('C88', 'R41'), ('C88', 'M11')]","['C61', 'M11', 'L93', 'R41', 'C53', 'J23', 'C88']","False","True","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.25","0.0","0.0","","","['L93', 'J23', 'R41', 'M11']","['C53', 'C61', 'C88']"

Our extension of Eisenberg's analysis 20 years later into the state court context, however, does not uncover any statistically significant association between a plaintiff's success at trial and preserving that trial victory on appeal. Our results imply that a plaintiff's decision to pursue litigation to a trial court conclusion is analytically distinct from the plaintiff's decision to defend an appeal of its trial court win brought by a disgruntled defendant. We consider various factors that likely account for the observed differences that distinguish our results from Eisenberg's. First, legal cases that persist to an appellate outcome are a filtered subset of underlying trials and legal disputes and various selection effects inform much of this case filtering. Second, where Eisenberg analyzed the relation between pretrial motions and trial outcomes in federal courts, we assess possible relations between trial and appellate court outcomes in state courts.

Adalimumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept are high-cost medications in the United States and Australia. A comparison of their prices over time may elucidate how ophthalmic medication prices contribute to health care costs. <h3>Objective</h3> To compare changes in the prices of adalimumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept in the United States and Australia, the highest and lowest spenders on health care, respectively, among high-income nations. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This retrospective price comparison study examined prices paid by government entities in the United States (Medicare) and Australia (Pharmaceuticals and Benefits Scheme). The analysis and data collection were conducted from March 28 to May 4, 2018, in accordance with guidelines set by the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Task Force on Good Research Practices and prior published studies. No human participants or related data were included in this study. <h3>Exposures</h3> The change in mean prices of adalimumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept in the United States and Australia. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Initial, final, and change in medication price annually from 2013 to 2017 in inflation-adjusted 2017 US dollars. <h3>Results</h3> The mean prices (US dollar prices unadjusted for inflation) in 2013 and 2017 in the United States were $1114 ($1053) and $1818 ($1818), respectively, for adalimumab; $2102 ($1988) and $1904 ($1904), respectively, for ranibizumab; and $2074 ($1961) and $1956 ($1956), respectively, for aflibercept. The mean (Australian dollar prices unadjusted for inflation) 2013 and 2017 prices in Australia were $1854 (A $1797) and $1206 (A $1574), respectively, for adalimumab; $2157 (A $2090) and $972 (A $1268), respectively, for ranibizumab; and $2030 (A $1967) and $996 (A $1300), respectively, for aflibercept. The estimated annual change in price for adalimumab was +12.8% (95% CI, 9.1%-16.5%) in the United States compared with −11.1% (95% CI, −15.0% to −7.1%) in Australia, a difference of 23.9% per year (95% CI, 19.7%-28.0%;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). The annual change in price for ranibizumab was −2.6% (95% CI, −3.9% to −1.3%) in the United States compared with −18.5% (95% CI, −29.3% to −7.8%) in Australia, a difference of 15.9% per year (95% CI, 7.6%-24.2%;<i>P</i> = .003). The annual change in price for aflibercept was −1.5% (95% CI, −2.2% to −0.7%) in the United States compared with −16.9% (95% CI, −25.1% to −8.6%) in Australia, a difference of 15.4% (95% CI, 9.1%-21.8%;<i>P</i> = .001). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Results of this study indicate that the prices of adalimumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept significantly decreased during the past 5 years in Australia compared with the United States. These data do not indicate why these differences are noted or what actions might affect future pricing in either country.","2019","[('C43', 'I18'), ('C43', 'I11'), ('C43', 'H51'), ('C43', 'F62'), ('C43', 'L65'), ('C18', 'I18'), ('C18', 'I11'), ('C18', 'H51'), ('C18', 'F62'), ('C18', 'L65')]","['I18', 'I11', 'H51', 'F62', 'L65', 'C43', 'C18']","False","True","False","False","False","False","0.0105979375318633","0.202280958007322","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['I18', 'I11', 'H51', 'F62', 'L65']","['C43', 'C18']"

However, because of widespread use and policy relevance, the underlying concept of polycentricity has become a ‘stretched concept’ in urban studies. As a result, academic debate on the topic leads to situations reminiscent of Babel’s Tower. This meta-study of the scientific literature in urban studies traces the conceptual stretching of polycentricity using scientometric methods and content analysis. All published studies that either apply the concept directly or cite a work that does, were collected from the Scopus bibliographic database. This resulted in a citation network with over 9000 works and more than 20,000 citations between them. Network analysis and clustering algorithms were used to define the most influential papers in different citation clusters within the network. Subsequently, we employed content analysis to systematically assess the mechanisms associated with the formation of polycentric urban systems in each of these papers. Based on this meta-analysis, we argue that the common categorisation of polycentricity research in intra-urban, inter-urban and inter-regional polycentricity is somewhat misleading. More apt categorisations to understand the origins of polycentricity’s conceptual ambiguity relate to different methodological traditions and geographical contexts in which the research is conducted. Nonetheless, we observe a firm relation across clusters between assessments of polycentricity and different kinds of agglomeration economies. We conclude by proposing a re-conceptualisation of polycentricity based on explicitly acknowledging the variable spatial impact of these different kinds of agglomeration economies.","2015","[('Y80', 'R12'), ('Y80', 'R10'), ('Y80', 'R58'), ('Y80', 'O18'), ('C55', 'R12'), ('C55', 'R10'), ('C55', 'R58'), ('C55', 'O18'), ('C18', 'R12'), ('C18', 'R10'), ('C18', 'R58'), ('C18', 'O18')]","['Y80', 'R10', 'O18', 'R12', 'R58', 'C55', 'C18']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.1428571428571428","0.0","0.0","0.25","0.2916666666666666","0.0","['R12', 'R10', 'R58', 'O18']","['Y80', 'C55', 'C18']"

In a ‘service and client’ climate, taxpayers do not expect authorities to automatically suspect them of being tax evaders. Evidence suggests that recognising good tax behaviour with strategies of rewards has a positive effect on voluntary tax compliance. Principles derived from the cognitive evaluation theory predict that when feelings of competence are affirmed and this is accompanied by a sense of autonomy it can enhance the intrinsic motivation for an action. The present research surveyed the attitudes and beliefs of taxpayers involved in small business on being rewarded for tax compliance. Results were corroborated with the principles of the cognitive evaluation theory and it was found that that the principles of the theory are applicable to rewarding tax compliance behaviour.","2015","[('C83', 'D12'), ('C83', 'H26'), ('C83', 'H21'), ('C83', 'D03'), ('C83', 'M41'), ('C91', 'D12'), ('C91', 'H26'), ('C91', 'H21'), ('C91', 'D03'), ('C91', 'M41')]","['D12', 'C91', 'H26', 'H21', 'D03', 'M41', 'C83']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.375","0.5","['D12', 'H26', 'H21', 'M41']","['C83', 'C91']"

We exploit this opportunity by using a Bayesian framework to learn a set of mappings from five-dimensional velocity, movement, and location vectors to intrinsic pitch values. A kernel method generates nonparametric estimates for the component probability density functions in Bayes theorem while nonparametric regression is used to derive a batted ball weight function that is invariant to the defense, ballpark, and atmospheric conditions. Cross-validation is used to determine the parameters of the model. We use Cronbach’s alpha to show that intrinsic pitch values have a significantly higher reliability than outcome-based pitch values. We also develop a method to combine intrinsic values at the individual pitch level into a statistic that captures the value of a pitcher’s collection of pitches over a period of time. We use this statistic to show that pitchers who outperform their intrinsic values during a season tend to perform worse the following year. We also show that this statistic provides better predictive value for future Earned Run Average (ERA) than either current ERA or Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP).","2018","[('C14', 'Z20'), ('C14', 'L83'), ('C93', 'Z20'), ('C93', 'L83'), ('C15', 'Z20'), ('C15', 'L83'), ('C53', 'Z20'), ('C53', 'L83'), ('C51', 'Z20'), ('C51', 'L83')]","['C14', 'C93', 'C15', 'C53', 'Z20', 'L83', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['Z20', 'L83']","['C14', 'C93', 'C15', 'C53', 'C51']"

We first explicitly give the default boundaries and the values of a deposit, straight bond, WD bond, equity and bank asset, and then use a numerical example to demonstrate the relations among leverage, deposits, WD bonds and bank value. Our results show that value-maximizing banks select the ratio of deposit, straight bond and WD debt so that endogenous default is consistent with exogenous bank closure. The bank increases its leverage by swapping both deposits and straight bonds for WD bonds. And the issuance of WD bonds not only reduces the expected bankruptcy loss and credit spread of straight bonds, but also improves the bank value. This indicates that WD bonds do help to stabilize banks. We also study the role of deposit insurance and the Chinese Financial Stability Bureau (FSB), and give a closed-form expression for the fair insurance premium. Lastly, to check the robustness of our results, we do the sensitivity analysis and investigate the effect of three sets of exogenous parameters on bank capital structure: WD parameters, bank business features, closure rules and insurance subsidy, and obtain some practically significant implications.","2018","[('C61', 'G21'), ('C61', 'G28'), ('C61', 'G32'), ('C61', 'E44'), ('C61', 'G01'), ('C15', 'G21'), ('C15', 'G28'), ('C15', 'G32'), ('C15', 'E44'), ('C15', 'G01')]","['C61', 'G21', 'C15', 'G28', 'G32', 'E44', 'G01']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0153846153846153","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['G21', 'G28', 'G32', 'E44', 'G01']","['C61', 'C15']"

The method of critical analysis of scientific and methodological literature is used. The methods of valuation of startup companies offered by well-known experts in the field of business valuation are summarized and systematized. Valuating startup companies an appraiser should search for alternative methods of valuation. Given the fact that there is no perfect valuation methodology of a startup company, we can suggest that an appraiser should use different methods of valuation (or a combination of them) to arrive at the right conclusion. Using several methods of valuation of startups you can come to the average value which may be closer to reality because all the alternative startup valuation methods are based on predictions and probabilities. To assess the value of a startup company that do not yet have profits, it is the most appropriate to use such methods as: the Berkus Method, Risk Factor Summation Method, Scorecard Valuation Method (Bill Payne Method), First Chicago Method, Venture Capital Method. When a company gives a stable profit it is more correct to use traditional methods of business valuation. The article substantiates the inexpediency of classical methodological approaches and methods for assessing the value of startup companies. A generalization of classical and new methodological approaches and methods of business valuation for startup companies is conducted. The prospects of further studies are determined: searching of the most acceptable methods of estimation of value of startup companies depending on the stage of the life cycle of a company and a sector in which it operates.","2018","[('G32', 'O32'), ('G32', 'L26'), ('G32', 'G24'), ('M13', 'O32'), ('M13', 'L26'), ('M13', 'G24'), ('C18', 'O32'), ('C18', 'L26'), ('C18', 'G24'), ('M41', 'O32'), ('M41', 'L26'), ('M41', 'G24')]","['G24', 'O32', 'M13', 'G32', 'M41', 'L26', 'C18']","False","False","False","True","False","True","","","0.0","0.0","","","['O32', 'L26', 'G24']","['G32', 'M13', 'C18', 'M41']"

The individual factors are added to the regression, the respondents' cognition and travel behavior have a great impact on WTP. Finally, the distance of the boundary of willingness to pay for the policy of returning farmland to forest is 54.90km. Under the influence of individual differences, the willingness to pay produces different distribution results in different distance and social attribute zoning, indicating that the effects of distance and other factors on WTP take place simultaneously and the levels of willingness to pay are heterogeneous. This kind of spatial difference should be fully taken into consideration when calculating the value of externalities and the amount of compensation for the restricted area. By analyzing the externality differences in cognition and payment, this paper can provide a support to improve the differential policies in compensations.","2017","[('C31', 'Q24'), ('C31', 'H41'), ('C31', 'R10'), ('C31', 'Q51'), ('C31', 'Q53'), ('C21', 'Q24'), ('C21', 'H41'), ('C21', 'R10'), ('C21', 'Q51'), ('C21', 'Q53')]","['Q24', 'H41', 'R10', 'Q51', 'C31', 'Q53', 'C21']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['Q24', 'H41', 'R10', 'Q51', 'Q53']","['C31', 'C21']"

Journal of International Money and Finance 28, no. 2: 322–43] to quantify the incremental benefits of foreign overnight international stock market information over domestic market momentum information. The main objective is to answer the question: how much more (or less) returns will a day trader earn by using various combinations of different interpretations of foreign news signals and domestic market momentum than the latter alone? Trading strategies are constructed with added features that take advantage of better modelling of changes over time in the return equivalent of the meteor shower of Engle, Ito, and Lin [Meteor showers or heat waves? Heteroscedastic intra-daily volatility in the foreign exchange market. Econometrica 58, no. 3: 525–42]. The results show that overnight international information is more economically beneficial than previous-day's domestic information. Moreover, better modelling of the time variation in the impact of this overnight information has substantial benefits to stock market investors.Keywords: meteor showerinformation transmissionKalman filterFITJEL Classification: G15 AcknowledgementsThe authors thank Michael Melvin, Kenneth Kroner and seminar participants at BlackRock (San Francisco), University of Stirling and Heriot-Watt University for comments on earlier versions of this paper.

Thus, DJIA is taken as the y variable, NIKKEI as the x variable and FTSE as the z variable in the FIT model of Equations (1)–(3). The chronological sequence of trading in these markets is preserved in the empirical application. Accordingly, signals (returns) from NIKKEI trades occur prior to NYSE open on the same day, and FTSE signals, which are from a market that is intermediate in time (up to 2 or 3 pm GMT), affect the relationship between DJIA and NIKKEI.3. We investigate effects of relaxing this assumption later on in the text. For the same reason, we have chosen the above version of RSI over a more traditional version where RS is defined in terms of only numbers of positive or negative price changes (i.e. a version that ignores relative return magnitude).4. The rule is simplified to the cases when the steady-state values of alpha i.e. α¯ are either zero or positive and those of beta, β¯ are positive. Estimation results of the relationships considered, reported in Table 2, show that all estimates of ¯ α are zero and those of β¯ are positive. Thus, predicted, expected, or forecast returns of market y are directly proportional to returns from the signalling market, x.5. Note that this construction, by and large, uses one set of information (the domestic set) to filter the other set (the foreign set) with the aim of strengthening or weakening the conviction of the domestic investor about the direction of the day-ahead returns. An investor with only foreign information is in possession of a smaller set of information but would perhaps trade more frequently. This is because the additional set of domestic information effectively reduces the number of trades by forcing the investor to be more selective of which trades to initiate (and with what leverage).6. DJIA day returns series exhibit significant alpha and beta GARCH(1,1) coefficients of 0.0664 (9.93) and 0.9262 (130.60), where values in parenthesis are z-statistics. The same coefficient estimates for NIKKEI are 0.0800 (11.03) and 0.9097 (117.36), and for FTSE are 0.1024 (10.70) and 0.8903 (89.83). The sum of alpha and beta is less than 1 for all three relationships, which shows stationarity. A battery of tests on heteroskedasticity and autocorrelations, reported in Table 2, further confirm the adequacy of a GARCH(1,1) lag structure.7. Although estimations of the relationships are carried out using 'standardised' returns, the trading strategies are obviously carried out on non-standardised returns to reflect actual trading gains or losses.8. In general, the value that R2 takes on tends to be low when the magnitude of returns expected or forecasted by a model is small relative to that of actual observed returns. This is true despite the fact that the model may form perfectly correct expectations or forecasts of the direction of returns. Direction quality measures such as those we present in Table 6 are more reflective of a model's ability to forecast return direction, which is a feature that is central to the profitability of the trading strategies considered.9. Conceptually, such risk would arise mainly from conducting highly leveraged trades based on wrong forecasts during volatile days. Technically, the DJIA needs to crash by 16.67% for one who applies our highest level of leverage (a multiple of 6) to lose all fund capital in one single day. Obviously, a series of high leveraged trades based on wrong forecasts can lead to the same demise over an extended period.10. This benefit is cumulative with the FIT model's ability at allocating leverage based on categories of intensity deviations. Section 4.5 investigates FIT's ability at allocating leverage by isolating its performance.11. The largest leverage of 3 is applied to approximately 40% of FIT trades – these are trades initiated as a result of forecast intensity (beta) deviations that belong to the two outermost quintiles (first and fifth quintiles) of beta deviations. In other words, these are trades carried out during days when the intensity impact of foreign information is forecast to be strongest. Another 40% of trades get allocated a leverage of 2 (second and fourth quintiles), and 20% of trades a leverage of 1 (middle quintile).12. The ability to predict return direction is analysed in detail in Section 4.5 by using direction quality measures.13. Bounds for RSI strategies will obviously need to be pre-specified before trading. This can be done using in-sample data.14. Other momentum measures would probably show similar performance to RSI, since such measures are based on the same principle of relative moving averages. For example, a moving average convergence divergence (MACD) of 10/30 (−3%, 3%), where 10/30 are the respective short and long moving average lengths and the (−3%, 3%) are the filter bounds, gives identical direction signals to those given by the RSI (10 lags with 20/80 bounds used in this study) during days when they both give a signal. An MACD of 10/30 (0%, 0%) gives signals that coincide 73% of the time with those given by RSI (10 lags with 50/50 bounds).15. Many of the Treynor betas, especially for funds based on DJIA and FTSE, are either statistically insignificantly different from zero or negative during the out-of-sample period. Average excess returns, however, are positive for all funds. For cases of zero betas, this is evidence of a risk adjustment not explaining away the performance of corresponding strategies. We thank an anonymous referee for this observation. Nonetheless, it is well known that the Treynor measure is hard or impossible to interpret when betas are negative, and cannot be calculated when betas are zero. Accordingly, the Treynor measure is not reported, but relevant calculations are available from the authors upon request.16. These are cumulative gross returns (holding period returns). These values are noted in the caption of Table 4.","2012","[('C22', 'G15'), ('C22', 'G11'), ('C22', 'G14'), ('C22', 'F30'), ('C53', 'G15'), ('C53', 'G11'), ('C53', 'G14'), ('C53', 'F30'), ('C32', 'G15'), ('C32', 'G11'), ('C32', 'G14'), ('C32', 'F30')]","['G11', 'G15', 'C32', 'G14', 'C22', 'C53', 'F30']","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","0.0","0.0","","","['G15', 'G11', 'G14', 'F30']","['C22', 'C53', 'C32']"

The evidence across a sample of 19 industrial countries differentiates the effects of expansionary and contractionary aggregate demand shocks on real output growth and nominal wage and price inflation. The difference appears consistent with a kinked supply curve that is dependent on the asymmetric flexibility of wages and/or prices across countries. Furthermore, the evidence does not support the endogeneity of asymmetric nominal flexibility with respect to demand variability or trend price inflation across countries. On average, across countries, demand variability increases nominal wage and price inflation relative to deflation, while exacerbating output contraction relative to expansion. The apparent trade-off between changes in real and nominal trends provides further support to the supply side explanation of asymmetry.","2009","[('C32', 'E32'), ('C32', 'F41'), ('C32', 'E31'), ('C32', 'E52'), ('C32', 'F44'), ('C51', 'E32'), ('C51', 'F41'), ('C51', 'E31'), ('C51', 'E52'), ('C51', 'F44')]","['C32', 'F41', 'F44', 'E31', 'E52', 'E32', 'C51']","True","True","True","True","True","True","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['E32', 'F41', 'E31', 'E52', 'F44']","['C32', 'C51']"

Transmission across differentiated agricultural products is important to investigate, but it has not been explored given its complexities for assessment. Using data from Australian cattle markets, we examine the dynamics of Meat Standards Australia price premium transmission between states. An impulse response function analysis using Bayesian vector autoregression with sign restriction identification shows that shocks to prices and price premiums are partially transmitted contemporaneously between markets and it takes several weeks to complete transmission. In addition, we find an asymmetry of price and price premium shocks originating in Southern Queensland that have an inverse immediate impact in New South Wales, and take months to transmit the usual price response. This outcome may be explained by differences in cattle availability in each state, which can be related to forage availability due to weather conditions. Based on these results, producers can forecast fluctuations on price premiums and adjust their cattle supply accordingly.","2017","[('C53', 'D40'), ('C53', 'Q11'), ('C53', 'Q13'), ('C53', 'R11'), ('C32', 'D40'), ('C32', 'Q11'), ('C32', 'Q13'), ('C32', 'R11'), ('C01', 'D40'), ('C01', 'Q11'), ('C01', 'Q13'), ('C01', 'R11')]","['R11', 'C32', 'Q13', 'D40', 'C53', 'Q11', 'C01']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.25","0.0","0.0","0.25","0.1111111111111111","['D40', 'Q11', 'Q13', 'R11']","['C53', 'C32', 'C01']"

One way to structurally interpret the model is by assuming aggregate demand has no long‐run output effect. However, many economic theories are inconsistent with that assumption. Instead, we reinterpret the statistical model assuming a positive shock to aggregate supply lowers the price level and in the long run raises output while a positive shock to aggregate demand raises the price level. Under these assumptions, a puzzling finding from the empirical literature implies that a positive aggregate demand shock had a long‐run positive effect on output in pre–World War I economies.","2013","[('C53', 'E13'), ('C53', 'N10'), ('C53', 'E32'), ('C53', 'E52'), ('C32', 'E13'), ('C32', 'N10'), ('C32', 'E32'), ('C32', 'E52'), ('C51', 'E13'), ('C51', 'N10'), ('C51', 'E32'), ('C51', 'E52')]","['C32', 'N10', 'E13', 'C53', 'E52', 'E32', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['E13', 'N10', 'E32', 'E52']","['C53', 'C32', 'C51']"

Given limited resources, this often results in extended appointment waiting times. Over the last 3 years, the Cancer Genetics Service at the National Cancer Centre Singapore has continued to experience a steady increase in demand for its service. Nevertheless, significant no-show rates have been reported. This study sought to determine whether an association exists between appointment waiting times and attendance rates. Data was gathered for all participants meeting inclusion criteria. Attendance rates and appointment waiting times were calculated. The relationship between mean waiting times for those who did and did not attend their scheduled appointments was evaluated using Welch's t test and linear regression model. The results showed a significant difference in mean appointment waiting times between patients who did and did not attend (32.66 versus 43.50 days respectively; p < 0.0001). Furthermore, patients who waited for longer than 37 days were significantly less likely to attend. No-show rates increased as the waiting time increased, at a rate of 19.60% per 20 days and 21.40% per 30 days. In conclusion, appointment waiting time is a significant predictor for patient attendance. Strategies to ensure patients receive an appointment within the necessary timeframe at the desired setting are important to ensure that individuals at increased cancer risk attend their appointments in order to manage their cancer risks effectively.","2018","[('C20', 'I11'), ('C20', 'H51'), ('C20', 'D12'), ('C20', 'I18'), ('C10', 'I11'), ('C10', 'H51'), ('C10', 'D12'), ('C10', 'I18'), ('C12', 'I11'), ('C12', 'H51'), ('C12', 'D12'), ('C12', 'I18')]","['D12', 'I18', 'I11', 'H51', 'C20', 'C10', 'C12']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['I11', 'H51', 'D12', 'I18']","['C20', 'C10', 'C12']"

We used an augmented gravity model with a panel data for 21 years. This paper utilizes the panel fixed effects decomposition and Hausman and Taylor estimation methods to estimate the effect of time-invariant variables on the volume of potential trade. The present volume of trade is dwarfed by our estimates of the potential trade. This seems to ratify the expectation of businesses on both sides. It would appear that the development of a bilateral relationship between India and Pakistan, in the context of regionalization, should be motivated by strong economic considerations. It would include sector-driven as well as market-access approaches. While the theoretical background appears subtle, strategic market consequences arise from the dynamics of regional market structure. Assuming a positive relationship between trade and per capita income, here is a peace dividend that is difficult to ignore in a regional environment of oppressive poverty.","2011","[('C23', 'O19'), ('C23', 'F14'), ('C23', 'O53'), ('C23', 'F10'), ('C23', 'F15'), ('C33', 'O19'), ('C33', 'F14'), ('C33', 'O53'), ('C33', 'F10'), ('C33', 'F15')]","['O19', 'F14', 'O53', 'F10', 'C23', 'F15', 'C33']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.6","1.0","0.0","0.0","0.5","1.0","['O19', 'F14', 'O53', 'F10', 'F15']","['C23', 'C33']"

We model a competitive dealership market for equities with two order sizes using a Poisson process mixture model and use TORQ data to estimate the parameters for the model via the method of maximum likelihood. The PIN for small and large trades are functions of the resulting parameter estimates. In our empirical tests, we find that although for the majority of securities information contents in small and large trades are similar, the average PIN for small trades is significantly higher than that in large trades. We also find that trading volume and institutional trading are the primary determinants of information content in small and large trades, respectively, but not of both. A further investigation of the securities with the largest differences in terms of PINs for small and large trades reveals that trade size alone distinguishes those firms from the rest – all eight firms reside in the lowest quartile in terms of average trade size.","2011","[('C22', 'D82'), ('C22', 'G10'), ('C22', 'G20'), ('C22', 'G14'), ('C13', 'D82'), ('C13', 'G10'), ('C13', 'G20'), ('C13', 'G14'), ('C51', 'D82'), ('C51', 'G10'), ('C51', 'G20'), ('C51', 'G14')]","['G20', 'G10', 'G14', 'C22', 'D82', 'C13', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.2888888888888889","0.2222222222222222","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['D82', 'G10', 'G20', 'G14']","['C22', 'C13', 'C51']"

Our analysis focuses on two well-studied measures of efficiency, termed the price of anarchy and price of stability, which provide worst-case guarantees on the performance of the (worst or best) equilibria. Our first result characterizes the cost-sharing design that optimizes the price of anarchy, followed by the price of stability. This optimal cost-sharing rule is precisely the Shapley value cost-sharing rule. Our second result characterizes the cost-sharing design that optimizes the price of stability, followed by the price of anarchy. This optimal cost-sharing rule is precisely the marginal contribution cost-sharing rule. This analysis highlights a fundamental tradeoff between the price of anarchy and price of stability in the considered class of games. That is, given the optimality of both the Shapley value and marginal cost distribution rules in each of their respective domains, it is impossible to improve either the price of anarchy or price of stability without degrading its counterpart.","2017","[('C71', 'D47'), ('C71', 'D82'), ('C71', 'L13'), ('C71', 'D62'), ('C72', 'D47'), ('C72', 'D82'), ('C72', 'L13'), ('C72', 'D62'), ('C63', 'D47'), ('C63', 'D82'), ('C63', 'L13'), ('C63', 'D62')]","['C72', 'C63', 'D62', 'C71', 'D47', 'D82', 'L13']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.1666666666666666","0.0","0.0","","","['D47', 'D82', 'L13', 'D62']","['C71', 'C72', 'C63']"

An assumption of role of clusters as driving force of smart growth with respective effect on service sector development is being raised and discussed. It is claimed, that smart growth will contribute to expansion of service sector; i.e. will accelerate the processes observed now. The analitical part of the paper is devoted to long range forecasting (until year 2050) of energy intensity of service sector in selected countries of different development. The aim of such forecasting is to reveal if energy intensities in service sector will diminish and converge as result of innovative processes affected by clustering of stakeholders, wich are business companies, universities, state and society. We claim that clustering of listed stakeholders through technology and consumption culture transfer affect energy intensity change trends in service sector and push it down. We argue that interrelationships among clusters, smart growth and energy security (through diminishing energy intensity in service sectors of differently developed countries) could be traced. We assume that indicated interrelationship does not depend on level of countries’ development; anyway less developed European countries benefit mire from clustering phenomenon.","2017","[('C53', 'Q43'), ('C53', 'R11'), ('C53', 'O13'), ('C53', 'O33'), ('C53', 'L26'), ('C51', 'Q43'), ('C51', 'R11'), ('C51', 'O13'), ('C51', 'O33'), ('C51', 'L26')]","['Q43', 'R11', 'O13', 'O33', 'C53', 'L26', 'C51']","False","True","False","False","False","False","0.2666666666666666","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.1666666666666666","0.0","['Q43', 'R11', 'O13', 'O33', 'L26']","['C53', 'C51']"

With an indefinite sequence of growth opportunities that have constant returns to scale, current investment neither displaces nor impairs future returns. In a dynamic setting with expansion restricted to a fraction of firm size, the endogenously determined cost of capital uniformly exceeds the value maximizing return threshold for expansion. Taking this into account, a manager accelerates investment to facilitate larger and more valuable future investments when earnings stochastically improve. This result is the opposite of deferral that the investment literature recommends due to irreversibility. This means that the managerial application of the cost of capital as an expansion hurdle rate is improperly conservative.","2009","[('C61', 'D21'), ('C61', 'M11'), ('C61', 'G32'), ('C61', 'D92'), ('C61', 'G31'), ('C73', 'D21'), ('C73', 'M11'), ('C73', 'G32'), ('C73', 'D92'), ('C73', 'G31')]","['D21', 'C61', 'M11', 'G32', 'D92', 'G31', 'C73']","True","True","True","True","True","True","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['D21', 'M11', 'G32', 'G31']","['C61', 'C73']"

Growing environmental pressures and resource prices suggest that this may be increasingly inappropriate. This paper explores the relationship between intermediate input intensity, productivity and national accounts using a panel dataset of manufacturing subsectors in the USA over 47 years. The first contribution is to identify sectoral production functions that incorporate intermediate inputs, while allowing for heterogeneity in both technology and productivity. The second contribution is that the paper finds a negative correlation between intermediate input intensity and total factor productivity (TFP)--sectors that are less intensive in their use of intermediate inputs have higher productivity. This finding is replicated at the firm level. We propose tentative hypotheses to explain this association, but testing and further disaggregation of intermediate inputs is left for further work. Further work could also explore more directly the relationship between material inputs and economic growth--given the high proportion of materials in intermediate inputs, the results in this paper are suggestive of further work on material efficiency. Depending upon the nature of the mechanism linking a reduction in intermediate input intensity to an increase in TFP, the implications could be significant. A third contribution is to suggest that an empirical bias in productivity, as measured in national accounts, may arise due to the exclusion of intermediate inputs. Current conventions of measuring productivity in national accounts may overstate the productivity of resource-intensive sectors relative to other sectors.","2013","[('C01', 'O51'), ('C01', 'Q56'), ('C01', 'D24'), ('C01', 'O47'), ('C01', 'E01'), ('C33', 'O51'), ('C33', 'Q56'), ('C33', 'D24'), ('C33', 'O47'), ('C33', 'E01')]","['O51', 'Q56', 'O47', 'E01', 'D24', 'C01', 'C33']","True","True","False","False","False","True","0.0311111111111111","0.1125","0.0","0.0","","","['O51', 'Q56', 'D24', 'O47', 'E01']","['C01', 'C33']"

A cross‐country panel dataset of 71 countries from 2002 to 2014 was established. The empirical methodologies include panel unit root tests, panel variance ratio tests, and panel multiple regressions. The results of panel unit root tests and panel variance ratio tests show that stock markets in countries with high ICT diffusion are efficient while stock markets in countries with low or medium ICT diffusion are not all efficient. The results of panel regressions further show that the effect of ICT diffusion in reducing market noises was more significant than its effect in magnifying the noises.","2018","[('C23', 'G15'), ('C23', 'O33'), ('C23', 'G14'), ('C23', 'F30'), ('C12', 'G15'), ('C12', 'O33'), ('C12', 'G14'), ('C12', 'F30'), ('C51', 'G15'), ('C51', 'O33'), ('C51', 'G14'), ('C51', 'F30')]","['G15', 'O33', 'G14', 'C12', 'F30', 'C23', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.1666666666666666","0.2","['G15', 'O33', 'G14', 'F30']","['C23', 'C12', 'C51']"

Using detailed trade data from two brokers, the authors document that investors are reluctant to repurchase stocks previously sold for a loss and stocks that have risen in price subsequent to a prior sale. The authors propose that this behavior reflects investors’ emotional reactions to trading and their attempts to distance themselves from negative emotions (e.g., disappointment, regret). Investors are disappointed when they sell a stock for a loss and regret having ever purchased the stock; these negative emotions deter investors from later repurchasing stocks they sold for a loss. Having sold a stock, investors are disappointed if the stock continues to rise and regret having sold the stock in the first place; these negative emotions deter investors from repurchasing stocks that go up since being sold. Thus, investors engage in reinforcement learning by repurchasing stocks whose previous purchase resulted in positive emotions and avoiding stocks whose previous purchase resulted in negative emotions.","2011","[('C93', 'G11'), ('C93', 'G41'), ('C93', 'D87'), ('C93', 'G02'), ('C93', 'D03'), ('C91', 'G11'), ('C91', 'G41'), ('C91', 'D87'), ('C91', 'G02'), ('C91', 'D03')]","['C93', 'G11', 'G41', 'C91', 'D87', 'G02', 'D03']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.3203703703703703","0.5972222222222222","0.0","0.0","0.4166666666666667","0.3749999999999999","['G11', 'G41', 'D87']","['C93', 'C91']"

We suggest that existing work on effectiveness of macroprudential policy may be vulnerable to bias due to omission of long run cointegration effects. This paper seeks to offer a fresh baseline for work in this area by adopting a cointegration framework which is robust to a variety of alternative techniques and compares favourably with non-cointegrated alternatives. We assess the impact of typical macroprudential policy interventions on house price and household credit growth in up to 19 OECD countries, using three datasets from the IMF and BIS, thus giving both a wider range of control variables and broader coverage of instruments than in most extant work. We find evidence that macroprudential polices remain effective in both short- and long-run at curbing house price and household credit growth even within a cointegration framework, albeit some tools are more effective than others. These include, in particular, taxes on financial institutions, general capital requirements, strict loan-to-value ratios and debt-to-income ratio limits.","2018","[('C32', 'G28'), ('C32', 'E44'), ('C32', 'E58'), ('C32', 'E61'), ('C32', 'G01'), ('C51', 'G28'), ('C51', 'E44'), ('C51', 'E58'), ('C51', 'E61'), ('C51', 'G01')]","['C32', 'G28', 'E44', 'E58', 'E61', 'G01', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['G28', 'E44', 'E58', 'E61', 'G01']","['C32', 'C51']"

Design/methodology/approach For the analysis, the authors use firm-level data on apprentices’ oral and writing competencies and competencies in basic mathematics, information technology and problem solving. The authors regress the apprentices’ productivity on these school competencies and include a number of firm and apprentice-specific control variables. By reducing the authors’ data set to firms that only have one apprentice the authors transform the firm-level data into quasi individual-level data. Findings The main findings are that not all competencies are equally related to productivity. Problem-solving competencies followed by oral and writing competencies show the strongest relation to the productive potential of apprentices. IT competencies are also positively but weakly related to the apprentices’ productivity. In contrast, higher levels of basic mathematical competencies leave productivity levels largely unchanged. Differentiating between occupational groups, the authors find that the positive relation between the competencies and productivity predominantly exists in commercial occupations rather than in industrial and technical occupations. Practical implications The results show that better school competencies are associated with a higher productivity of apprentices, which in turn lowers the firms’ training costs. From a policy perspective, this finding is important because it implies that, by improving the apprentices’ competencies, the firms’ willingness to participate in the apprenticeship system can be increased. Moreover, the results are important for training firms because they show on which competencies firms should focus in their recruitment decision. Originality/value The paper studies for the first time the relation between pre-training competencies and productivity of apprentices at the working place. A practical implication from the authors’ analysis is that it could be useful to implement tools measuring the problem solving and oral and writing competencies of apprenticeship applicants in the process of recruitment.","2017","[('C21', 'J31'), ('C21', 'I21'), ('C21', 'M53'), ('C21', 'D24'), ('C21', 'J24'), ('C01', 'J31'), ('C01', 'I21'), ('C01', 'M53'), ('C01', 'D24'), ('C01', 'J24')]","['J31', 'D24', 'I21', 'M53', 'J24', 'C21', 'C01']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.25","0.0","0.0","0.375","0.5","['J31', 'I21', 'M53', 'D24', 'J24']","['C21', 'C01']"

We propose a framework for comparing prognostic models by quantifying the public health impact (net benefit) of the treatment decisions they support, assuming a set of predetermined clinical treatment guidelines. The change in net benefit is more clinically interpretable than changes in traditional measures and can be used in full health economic evaluations of prognostic models used for screening and allocating risk reduction interventions. We extend previous work in this area by quantifying net benefits in life years, thus linking prognostic performance to health economic measures; by taking full account of the occurrence of events over time; and by considering estimation and cross‐validation in a multiple‐study setting. The method is illustrated in the context of cardiovascular disease risk prediction using an individual participant data meta‐analysis. We estimate the number of cardiovascular‐disease‐free life years gained when statin treatment is allocated based on a risk prediction model with five established risk factors instead of a model with just age, gender and region. We explore methodological issues associated with the multistudy design and show that cost‐effectiveness comparisons based on the proposed methodology are robust against a range of modelling assumptions, including adjusting for competing risks.

These data are obtained in the field in the Arcachon bay, with light-weight electrodes of millimeters size, attached to the molluscs, and linked by flexible wires to an electronic control unit which measures valve activity. The latter are able to move freely and open their valve with an amplitude which is linked to environmental and physiological conditions, in order to filter surrounding waters. We consider here daily data recorded every 0.1 sec for 16 different animals, corresponding to a total of 1 728 000 data points. Valvometry data show important intermittent activity at high frequency, with frequent and sudden ""microclosing"" events (meaning partial closures), at apparently random times and with random amplitudes. The overall frequency spectrum of valve opening time series show power-law behavior with a slope β = 1.6 ± 0.1. The random succession of closing events with random amplitudes suggests to consider a shot-noise analysis, with two independent stochastic processes representing respectively the times of these discrete shot noise events and their amplitudes. This shows that methods and approaches devoted to extreme values, chaotic dynamics, recurrence time statistics in geosciences and climate studies can also be used to study living organisms and their interactions with complex environments such as their local ecosystem.","2011","[('C14', 'Q01'), ('C14', 'Q57'), ('C22', 'Q01'), ('C22', 'Q57'), ('C53', 'Q01'), ('C53', 'Q57'), ('C02', 'Q01'), ('C02', 'Q57'), ('C16', 'Q01'), ('C16', 'Q57')]","['C14', 'C22', 'C53', 'C02', 'Q57', 'C16', 'Q01']","False","False","False","False","True","True","0.2506562065385595","0.75","0.0","0.0","","","['Q01', 'Q57']","['C14', 'C22', 'C53', 'C02']"

Design/methodology/approach – This paper uses monthly data over a long time series, since 1986, to investigate the relationships between house price and LIBOR. Data are drawn from several different sources to include housing, financial and macro-economic variables. The time series is sub-divided into a series of splines based on stages in the economic and property market cycle. Both value-based and percentage change models are developed. Findings – The results show that BoE base/LIBOR margin variable has a strong positive and significant effect on house price; however, the percentage change model infers a weaker and inverse relationship. The spline analysis re-emphasised the significance of the BoE base/LIBOR margin variable. Where variation between base rates and LIBOR is reduced, a significant positive effect can be observed in the average house price; however, where significant variation exists, the BoE base/LIBOR margin has little effect and LIBOR itself becomes a significant driver. Research limitations/implications – The results highlight that the predictive qualities of the BoE base/LIBOR margin, as the contribution of this margin to the explanation of house price, exceeds both the base rate and LIBOR variables individually. Also highlighted is the contribution of unemployment to the explanation of house price. In both the value and percentage change models, unemployment is shown as a negative and highly significant contributor. Originality/value – Previous papers have demonstrated the important linkage between house price and interest rates, the originality in this paper lies in examining the impact of LIBOR and the spreads between LIBOR and base rate as key variables influencing variation in UK house prices.","2015","[('C22', 'E47'), ('C22', 'R31'), ('C22', 'G21'), ('C22', 'E52'), ('C22', 'G12'), ('C51', 'E47'), ('C51', 'R31'), ('C51', 'G21'), ('C51', 'E52'), ('C51', 'G12')]","['G12', 'E47', 'G21', 'C22', 'E52', 'C51', 'R31']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['E47', 'R31', 'G21', 'E52', 'G12']","['C22', 'C51']"

In the model, individual heterogeneous investors interact with each other and with institutional devices which are an accounting system (related to the business firm) and a price system (related to the Share Exchange). These interactions provide mechanisms for transmission through which firm-specific (accounting signal) and market-driven (aggregate price) factors can act. A baseline simulation analysis assesses the financial market stability under three alternative accounting designs, namely two kinds of historical cost accounting regime and one kind of fair-value (mark-to-market) accounting regime. The former prove to better stabilize the financial system in terms of market volatility and exuberance in perfectly balanced conditions between speculative and fundamentalist beliefs and intentions. An evolutionary analysis is then developed by varying the relative degree of speculative attitudes between the two sides of the market. Historical cost accounting regimes further prove to make the financial system more resilient to speculative waves occurring at inter-individual level. Baseline findings are further corroborated through experimental analysis in twelve artificial financial systems. This mathematical institutional economic analysis has general implications for both designing accounting systems aimed at enhancing financial market stability and preventing procyclicality, and the study of accounting information process in the formation of share market prices over time.","2015","[('C15', 'G10'), ('C15', 'D53'), ('C15', 'M41'), ('C15', 'E32'), ('C15', 'G20'), ('C63', 'G10'), ('C63', 'D53'), ('C63', 'M41'), ('C63', 'E32'), ('C63', 'G20')]","['G10', 'C63', 'C15', 'D53', 'M41', 'E32', 'G20']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.1","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['G10', 'D53', 'M41', 'E32', 'G20']","['C15', 'C63']"

Estimating the prevalence of HIV in pregnant women provides essential information for an effective implementation of HIV/AIDS control measures and monitoring of HIV spread within a country. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of HIV infection, risk factors for HIV/AIDS and immunologic (lymphocyte profile) characteristics among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in three district hospitals in North-Rift, Kenya.Blood samples were collected from pregnant women attending antenatal clinics in three district hospitals (Kitale, Kapsabet and Nandi Hills) after informed consent and pre-test counseling. The samples were tested for HIV antibodies as per the guidelines laid down by Ministry of Health, Kenya. A structured pretested questionnaire was used to obtain demographic data. Lymphocyte subset counts were quantified by standard flow cytometry.Of the 4638 pregnant women tested, 309 (6.7%) were HIV seropositive. The majority (85.1%) of the antenatal attendees did not know their HIV status prior to visiting the clinic for antenatal care. The highest proportion of HIV infected women was in the age group 21-25 years (35.5%). The 31-35 age group had the highest (8.5%) HIV prevalence, while women aged more than 35 years had the lowest (2.5%).Women in a polygamous relationship were significantly more likely to be HIV infected as compared to those in a monogamous relationship (p = 0.000). The highest HIV prevalence (6.3%) was recorded among antenatal attendees who had attended secondary schools followed by those with primary and tertiary level of education (6% and 5% respectively). However, there was no significant relationship between HIV seropositivity and the level of education (p = 0.653 and p = 0.469 for secondary and tertiary respectively). The mean CD4 count was 466 cells/mm3 (9-2000 cells/mm3). Those that had less than 200 cells/mm3 accounted for 14% and only nine were on antiretroviral therapy.Seroprevalence of HIV was found to be consistent with the reports from the national HIV sentinel surveys. Enumeration of T-lymphocyte (CD4/8) should be carried out routinely in the antenatal clinics for proper timing of initiation of antiretroviral therapy among HIV infected pregnant women.","2009","[('C93', 'O54'), ('C93', 'J13'), ('C93', 'I12'), ('C93', 'I18'), ('C93', 'H51'), ('C81', 'O54'), ('C81', 'J13'), ('C81', 'I12'), ('C81', 'I18'), ('C81', 'H51')]","['O54', 'C93', 'J13', 'I12', 'I18', 'H51', 'C81']","True","True","True","True","True","True","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['O54', 'J13', 'I12', 'I18', 'H51']","['C93', 'C81']"

It derives a reaction function for the price of HFCS and a conjectural variations function. The conjectural variations function suggests that the price of sugar is higher than the price of HFCS.

Its convergence properties are well known in the case of globally Lipschitz continuous coefficients. However, in many situations, relevant systems do not show a smooth behavior, which results in SDE models with discontinuous drift coefficient. In this work, we analyze the long time properties of the Euler scheme applied to SDEs with a piecewise constant drift and a constant diffusion coefficient and carry out intensive numerical tests for its convergence properties. We emphasize numerical convergence rates and analyze how they depend on the properties of the drift coefficient and the initial value.

Dual health system use occurs when patients receive care from multiple facilities over time, and such fractured care has been associated with higher healthcare utilization and higher mortality in selected conditions.METHODS: We analyzed a cohort of 13,948 U.S. Veterans receiving emergency department (ED) or hospital care for heart failure between 2007-2011 using information from the VA, Medicare, and an all-payor state-level claims database. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to model the association between all-cause mortality and dual use comparing dual users to those receiving VA-only care or non-VA only care.RESULTS: In fully adjusted models accounting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, disability, and comorbidities, dual use Veterans with heart failure had higher hazard for mortality from their date of entry into the cohort (HR 1.21, 95% CI 1.11, 1.32, p&lt;0.0001) and from the date of their last hospitalization (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.28-1.53, p&lt;0.0001) as compared to VA-only users. Non-VA only users did not have significantly different hazard for mortality compared to VA-only users. Additional models in a subset of patients which also included laboratory data for brain-type natriuretic peptide, blood urea nitrogen, and serum sodium yielded similar results.CONCLUSIONS: Dual use appears to be associated with higher risk for mortality among Veterans with heart failure. While cross-system care is necessary and even desirable in many situations, strategies to identify high-risk patients and to mitigate risks of fractured care are warranted.","2017","[('C14', 'J14'), ('C14', 'I12'), ('C14', 'I18'), ('C14', 'I11'), ('C14', 'H51'), ('C21', 'J14'), ('C21', 'I12'), ('C21', 'I18'), ('C21', 'I11'), ('C21', 'H51')]","['C14', 'J14', 'I12', 'I18', 'I11', 'H51', 'C21']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['J14', 'I12', 'I18', 'I11', 'H51']","['C14', 'C21']"

Introduction The M-C model is based on the fact that the basic management processes of small and medium-sized companies must be designed in two interconnected areas management and controlling. Management is perceived as plans, targets, researches, missions and visions. Controlling is described as continuous monitoring and evaluation of targets, identification of deviations and proposals in the form of risk management. Management and controlling must be understood as decisive management activities (Halivcek, 2011). Planning and controlling are very interconnected activities that have to be understood within the framework of the company management concept, not as independent and separate activities of the company departments. Orientation on long-term and short-term targets is the basic step towards successful company management. However, without good and timely suggestions, checks and searches for alternative solutions, this subject is exposed to risk. Determining measures to eliminate a problem means intensive interconnection with creation of operational and strategic plans. It is a closed process, in which the success of the entire company is significant, not just of the company department. (Havlicek, 2011). The ability to manage these processes means understanding the principle of company management. It is a common managerial mistake to prefer soft skills to hard skills. Both approaches should be well-balanced in practice. An unusually strong competitive environment shows that marketing, innovation and human resources management become decisive company activities. However, the world crisis clearly showed that business is especially about company economics, results, specific numbers and about the ability to react to changes in time and to indicate and manage potential problems expressed in an exact way. Knowledge of the market, competent employees and innovative abilities are of no significance if the company does not generate sufficient cash to cover at least its operational needs. 2. Strategic Management and Planning To create a business strategy is a key managerial act resulting from proprietary objectives or the ambitions of owners and has a decisive influence on the determination of future position on the market. The strategy is the pillar for all other decisions, planning and implementation of operational targets (3). Strategic targets are superior to all activities and internal company units and are the basis for operational plans and concepts of individual company units--departments, divisions or sections. The sales, marketing, finance, quality and innovation departments or the human resources department, for example, shall base the determination of targets and plans on the business strategy and objectives of the individual company units whose targets must be adapted to the main company strategic targets. Every company must be able to define WHAT its position and targets are (corporate strategy), while it has to respect the ambitions and requirements of the owners and involved parties (ownership strategy). Every business strategy defined at the level of top management makes sense only if it is transferred to the level of the individual departments (business, finance, marketing, production, innovation, etc.) and the long-term position of these departments (managerial strategy) is determined (Halikias, 2009; Mallya, 2007; Kasik and Havlicek, 2009). The main output of company strategic management is creation of a strategic plan. It describes the position that the company will be in several years down the line (Havlicek, 2011). It informs us about its vision, mission and suggests ways to achieve long-term targets. It is a big managerial mistake to believe that determination of the long-term direction of the company is a marketing practice good only for an annual report, a company profile or a trailer on the corporate website. Its importance goes beyond the various departments in the company. …","2013","[('M10', 'D21'), ('M10', 'L20'), ('M10', 'O32'), ('M10', 'M13'), ('M10', 'L26'), ('C02', 'D21'), ('C02', 'L20'), ('C02', 'O32'), ('C02', 'M13'), ('C02', 'L26')]","['D21', 'L20', 'O32', 'M13', 'C02', 'M10', 'L26']","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","0.0","0.0","","","['D21', 'L20', 'O32', 'M13', 'L26']","['M10', 'C02']"

On average, B and H shares offer a better risk-adjusted return irrespective of whether the returns are measured in the Chinese Yuan (domestic perspective) or in the US dollar (foreign perspective) terms. However, a ‘timeline’ analysis indicates that the relative advantage arising from investment in B or H shares may be nearing the end. This finding appears to be a consequence of investment schemes which allow domestic and foreign investors to cross each other’s territories after opening up of the Chinese market to foreign investors. Second, there is some evidence of exchange rate advantage for foreign investors, even though it is negligible. The results of our study suggest that any additional benefit generated by slight (average annual) appreciation of Yuan against the dollar is offset by an increase in volatility of returns measured in the US dollar.","2015","[('C50', 'G11'), ('C50', 'G15'), ('C50', 'E44'), ('C50', 'F30'), ('C50', 'F31'), ('C10', 'G11'), ('C10', 'G15'), ('C10', 'E44'), ('C10', 'F30'), ('C10', 'F31')]","['C50', 'G11', 'G15', 'C10', 'E44', 'F30', 'F31']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0619047619047619","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['G11', 'G15', 'E44', 'F30', 'F31']","['C50', 'C10']"

A multivariate VAR analysis is carried out among five key macroeconomic variables: real gross domestic product, short term interest rate, real effective exchange rates, long term interest rate and money supply. From the VAR model, the impulse response functions reveal that oil price movements cause significant reduction in aggregate output and increase real exchange rate. The variance decomposition shows that crude oil prices significantly contribute to the variability of real exchange rate long term interest rate in the Pakistan economy while oil price shocks are found to have significant effects on money supply and short term interest rate in the economy. Despite these macro econometric results, caution must be exercised in formulating energy policies since future effects of upcomming oil shocks will not be the same as what happened in the past.

Note that persistent deficits and the accumulation of debt do not necessarily imply that the debt is unmanageable, and hence, that fiscal processes are unsustainable. It is possible for a government to change the historical pattern it has been following so that it will not continue to borrow and run a ‘Ponzi’ scheme in the future. This implies that the standard cointegration approach to testing whether a government adheres to its intertemporal budget constraint does not provide sufficient criteria for determining whether the fiscal process is truly sustainable. Consequently, we also use a more encompassing set of criteria under more realistic assumptions for determining whether the fiscal process in Egypt exhibits a sustainable budgeting process. These criteria for sustainability are based on the multicointegration approach. Therefore, both cointegration and multicointegration methodologies were used to evaluate these processes. It was found that the fiscal budgeting process in Egypt is sustainable in neither a stochastic nor a non-stochastic environment. Furthermore, the earlier and recent nationalisation of foreign trade resulted in an increase in deficits-GDP ratio. Adopting an austerity budget in 1967 and paying an additional cost of living allowance to government employees since 1975 were the only two policy regime changes which reduced the deficit per GDP.","2011","[('C32', 'H68'), ('C32', 'H63'), ('C32', 'O53'), ('C32', 'E62'), ('C32', 'E61'), ('C51', 'H68'), ('C51', 'H63'), ('C51', 'O53'), ('C51', 'E62'), ('C51', 'E61')]","['H68', 'C32', 'H63', 'O53', 'E62', 'E61', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['H68', 'H63', 'O53', 'E62', 'E61']","['C32', 'C51']"

Burden of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is rising in Sri Lanka. Assessing the validity of generic QOL tools creates new opportunities of their utilization among patients with CKD. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1036 CKD patients, selected using the simple random sampling technique. The validity was tested with six a-priori hypotheses. These included construct validity assessments, evaluating convergent validity and performing known group comparisons. EQ-5D-3L, Short Form-36 (SF-36) were used to assess QOL. Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D-20) and General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) were used to assess the presence of depression and psychological distress respectively. Internal consistency of the whole tool and when each item is removed was assessed by Cronbach alpha. Results The response rate was 99.2%. Majority of participants were males (n = 646,62.4%) in the age category of 41–60 (n = 530; 51.2%). Most were in either stage 4 or 5 of CKD (n = 646,75.1%).

The transition from fee-for-service to outcome-based reimbursements may make matters worse. Purpose/Objective: To investigate influences of provider attitudes and practice settings on job satisfaction/dissatisfaction during transition to quality-based payment models, we assessed self-reported satisfaction/dissatisfaction with practice in a Rochester (New York)-area physician practice association in the process of implementing pay-for-performance. Subjects/Methods: We linked cross-sectional data for 215 survey respondents on satisfaction ratings and behavioral attitudes with medical record data on their clinical behavior and practices, and census data on their catchment population. Factors associated with the odds of being satisfied or dissatisfied were determined via predictive multivariable logistic regression modeling. Results/Conclusions: Dissatisfied physicians were more likely to have larger-than-average patient panels, lower autonomy and/or control, and beliefs that quality incentives were hindering patient care. Satisfied physicians were more likely to have a higher sense of autonomy and control, smaller patient volumes, and a less complex patient mix.

Hence, this study examines the impact of cost sharing on utilization of Physician care. Methods: In the present study, multistage sampling (n = 1610) was done to collect general physician utilization and quality of life. Count data model was used to analyze the effect of cost sharing and other factor on the ratio of referring to the general physician. Negative binomial regression was employed to analyze the utilization model. Results: People who have high-cost sharing had used general physician services much less, so that ratio of incidence among them was 0.18 less than individuals with low-cost sharing (P < 0.05). Gender and age variables showed a significant effect on the demand for the general physician visit (P < 0.05). Conclusions: A low cost-sharing policy would remove the clinically and financial threat from the patient decision-making so as to provide them with access to needed care.","2018","[('C25', 'I10'), ('C25', 'D12'), ('C25', 'J14'), ('C25', 'I18'), ('C25', 'H51'), ('C13', 'I10'), ('C13', 'D12'), ('C13', 'J14'), ('C13', 'I18'), ('C13', 'H51')]","['I10', 'D12', 'J14', 'I18', 'C25', 'H51', 'C13']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0181818181818181","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['I10', 'D12', 'J14', 'I18', 'H51']","['C25', 'C13']"

We consider both a linear and non-linear model of PPP based on cointegration analysis and apply firstly Johansen's linear approach and then conduct Breitung's rank and score tests to search for any non-linear cointegrating relationship. The results obtained from Breitung's rank test suggest that once the sources of non-linearities are taken into account, the results provide stronger evidence on the empirical fulfillment of PPP. Keywords: Purchasing power paritynon-linear cointegrationnon-linearitiesrank testsdeveloping countriesKeywords: C22F31 Acknowledgements We would like to thank anonymous referees for their helpful comments and suggestions. These all make this article more valuable and readable. Any errors that remain are our own. Notes 1. Price equalizing effect of international trade is prevalent only for tradeables. The inclusion of non-tradable goods, whose prices are determined by productivity levels to some extent, in price indices may lead to deviations from PPP. Price differentials resulting from inter-country differences in the relative productivity of tradable and non-tradable sectors are discussed independently by Harrod (Citation1933), Balassa (Citation1964) and Samuelson (Citation1964), which is also known as the Harrod-Balassa-Samuelson Effect in the literature. 2. Krugman (Citation1987) refers to this practice of firms selling the same good for different prices in different markets as ""pricing-to-market"". 3. For an extensive view of empirical literature about PPP, see also Taylor (Citation2003), Taylor and Taylor (Citation2004) and Taylor (Citation2006). 4. Since there are three variables in the cointegration test, it would be possible to find two cointegrating vector and this does not cause any problem for our analysis. In this article, we are interested in applying a liberal version of PPP, thus, relax all restrictions on the coefficients so that the parameters β, β 1 and β 2 can assume different values. Our tests concentrate on the existence of any linear combination(s) of the variables that is stationary. Cheung and Lai (Citation1993) argued that the imposition of symmetry and proportionality conditions in the analysis can cause the restricted model to ignore possible interactions in the determination of exchange rates and prices that are allowed in the unrestricted model. 5. As stated by Hong and Phillips (Citation2010) neglecting non-linearity in a long-run relationship can be particularly crucial in non-stationary time series. For stationary time series, linear models may be sufficient to obtain workable approximations at least locally to non-linear models. In contrast to mean-reverting stationary processes, non-stationary time series have no tendency to turn fixed mean or locality in the sample space and, like random walks. In such cases, local linear approximations can only poorly represent the global characteristics of the process, producing a high risk of faulty inference about a misspecified long-run equilibrium. 6. We apply the Schwarz Bayesian Information Criterion to select appropriate leads and lags for DOLS. 7. Pippenger and Goering (Citation1993), Balke and Fomby (Citation1997) and Enders and Granger (Citation1998) argues that commonly used tests consider only for linear cointegration and have power problems when especially there is non-linear dynamics in the long-run equilibrium relation. In addition, KIlIç (Citation2011) states that the studies examining the non-linear adjustment in deviations from long-run equilibrium relations, in fact, subject to Davies (1987) problem; that is parameter(s) can be unidentified under the null hypothesis of no unit root, no-cointegration or no-non-linear adjustment.","2012","[('C22', 'O19'), ('C22', 'E31'), ('C22', 'F41'), ('C22', 'F31'), ('C32', 'O19'), ('C32', 'E31'), ('C32', 'F41'), ('C32', 'F31'), ('C51', 'O19'), ('C51', 'E31'), ('C51', 'F41'), ('C51', 'F31')]","['O19', 'C51', 'C32', 'F41', 'C22', 'E31', 'F31']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0208333333333333","0.0416666666666666","['O19', 'E31', 'F41', 'F31']","['C22', 'C32', 'C51']"

The objectives are to form groups of workers with high compatibility value and to have a high compatibility value for the worst group, too. The problem becomes more interesting if software collaborative groups or specialized intelligent agents are involved. One has to prospect also the level of knowledge overlap between the trade groups of agents.

The study proposes indicators for assessing the level of adaptability of the economic sectors to changes in prices for energy carriers and to risks of energy markets. The model of decomposition of adaptability level of the economy sectors to changes in energy prices has been developed. The theoretical and empirical analysis of the influence of energy prices on adaptability level of enterprises and households is carried out. Based on the empirical analysis, it was found that adaptability level of the sectors of Ukrainian economy significantly differs both in the years of the investigated period and in sectors of the economy. At the same time, most indicators of the level of adaptability vary from 0.4 to 0.7. Consequently, the actual decline in the profit of enterprises was 40–70% lower than the potentially possible decrease in the profit of these enterprises due to the prices rising for energy carriers. Moreover sectors which are less vulnerable to the growth of prices show higher adaptability level.The possibility of using the obtained results in developing a state energy saving strategy is substantiated.","2018","[('C30', 'Q40'), ('C30', 'E30'), ('C30', 'O13'), ('C30', 'Q47'), ('C50', 'Q40'), ('C50', 'E30'), ('C50', 'O13'), ('C50', 'Q47'), ('C10', 'Q40'), ('C10', 'E30'), ('C10', 'O13'), ('C10', 'Q47')]","['Q40', 'C50', 'E30', 'O13', 'C30', 'C10', 'Q47']","True","True","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.5","['Q40', 'E30', 'O13', 'Q47']","['C30', 'C50', 'C10']"

Tornado time series are viewed as the output of a complex system and are interpreted as a manifestation of its dynamics. Tornadoes are modeled as sequences of Dirac impulses with amplitude proportional to the events size. First, a collection of time series involving 64 years is analyzed in the frequency domain by means of the Fourier transform. The amplitude spectra are approximated by power law functions and their parameters are read as an underlying signature of the system dynamics.

Taking China and India as examples, we use new data on bilateral trade disaggregated by firm ownership type as well as measures of political relations based on bilateral events and United Nations voting data to estimate the effect of political relations on import flows since the early 1990s. Our results support the hypothesis that imports controlled by state-owned enterprises are more responsive to political relations than imports controlled by private enterprises. This finding suggests that politicized import decisions will increase as countries with partially state-controlled economies gain strength in the global economy.

This paper explores the effect of shocks in the exchange rate, oil price, and production as the three main shocks in the economy on the most important variable in Iran’s macroeconomy, i.e. price level. So, the vector auto-regression (VAR) model is used with seasonal data for the period of 1991-2016. After the model is estimated, impulse response functions are calculated and analysis of variance is performed to figure out the contribution of each shock in the variance of the prediction error of these variables. The results show that the strong dependence of exchange rate on foreign exchange earnings of oil price allows the rapid growth of the prices in Iran and the effect of the shock is increasing over time. Also, sanctions in 2012 did not reduce oil price, but they influenced the exchange rate and inflation significantly.","2018","[('C32', 'Q43'), ('C32', 'F41'), ('C32', 'E31'), ('C32', 'E52'), ('C32', 'F31'), ('C51', 'Q43'), ('C51', 'F41'), ('C51', 'E31'), ('C51', 'E52'), ('C51', 'F31')]","['Q43', 'C51', 'C32', 'F41', 'E31', 'E52', 'F31']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.1666666666666666","['Q43', 'F41', 'E31', 'E52', 'F31']","['C32', 'C51']"

The purpose of this study is to analyze the information content of Islamic capital market and money market return with respect to macroeconomic and global factors. Using bivariate method, we found that Islamic capital market index (JII) has more content information than Islamic money market index (SBIS). The exchange rate and VIX index significantly affected JII. Otherwise, only VIX index have been found to significantly affect SBIS. Using multivariate method, JII has more content information (exchange rate, world oil price, China's economic growth, and VIX index) than SBIS (SBI rate, inflation rate, and VIX index). Contradiction in these findings indicates the presence of (i) interaction between the macroeconomic variables, (ii) interaction between the financial market and the macroeconomic variables, and (iii) interaction between the Islamic capital market and money market.

These economies were admitted to the World Trade Organization in late 2001 (China) and in January 2002 (Taiwan). This study aims to redress this deficiency. Design/methodology/approach Using Johansen's cointegration approach and bilateral trade data, the study reveals overwhelming evidence of a stable long‐run relationship of the real exchange rate and bilateral trade balance between Taiwan and its trading partners: China, the USA, Japan, Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. Findings The evidence indicates that the currency depreciation of the New Taiwan dollar improves Taiwan's bilateral trade balance, except with China. Originality/value The findings imply that Taiwan cannot resolve the cross‐Strait trade imbalance alone via the currency depreciation, and macroeconomic adjustments, including application of the WTO rules, currency exchange and imports of Chinese goods, need to be negotiated on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.","2009","[('C32', 'F14'), ('C32', 'F41'), ('C32', 'F42'), ('C32', 'E52'), ('C32', 'F31'), ('C51', 'F14'), ('C51', 'F41'), ('C51', 'F42'), ('C51', 'E52'), ('C51', 'F31')]","['C51', 'F14', 'C32', 'F41', 'F42', 'E52', 'F31']","True","True","True","True","True","True","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['F14', 'F41', 'F42', 'E52', 'F31']","['C32', 'C51']"

We focus on two different, albeit not mutually exclusive, mechanisms that can explain the success of sanction threats. The first mechanism relates to incomplete information regarding the sanctioner's determination to impose sanctions and suggests that threats help to extract concessions by revealing the sanctioner's resolve. The second mechanism underscores the direct impact of common interest between the two countries and explains the success of sanction threats by the targeted country's greater dependence on this link between the two countries and the sanctioner's ability to exploit this dependence. We test the hypotheses using a new strategic structural estimator.

However, the 2007 credit crunch exposed the severe limitations of this approach. This article presents a methodological analysis of the N ew N eoclassical S ynthesis and how the paradigmatic heuristic of the representative agent, namely, market clearing subject to sticky prices, excluded the K eynesian notion of involuntary unemployment arising from lack of effective demand. It shows these models may be modified to produce K eynesian results, but are ruled out of consideration by proponents of the N ew N eoclassical approach by weak incommensurability. It concludes that because of this the N ew N eoclassical S ynthesis, in spite of its failure to explain the sub‐prime crisis, is likely to resist successfully the resurgence in K eynesian economics.","2013","[('B23', 'E00'), ('B23', 'E13'), ('B23', 'B41'), ('B23', 'E12'), ('B50', 'E00'), ('B50', 'E13'), ('B50', 'B41'), ('B50', 'E12'), ('C46', 'E00'), ('C46', 'E13'), ('C46', 'B41'), ('C46', 'E12')]","['B41', 'E12', 'B50', 'E13', 'B23', 'E00', 'C46']","False","False","True","True","False","False","","","0.3333333333333333","0.0","0.375","0.1666666666666666","['E00', 'E13', 'B41', 'E12']","['B23', 'B50', 'C46']"

As a consequence, distributed energy, especially distributed electricity power generation, has received more and more attention. Thus, the scale and utilization level of distributed energy has been continuously improved. However, due to the limitations of current technologies, resources, policies and other issues, the comprehensive benefits and synergy levels of energy sources need to be greatly enhanced. Based on the system dynamics model, this paper examines the factors affecting the comprehensive benefits of distributed energy in China, screens the key subjects, and using the literature review method, combined with the existing literature analysis, constructs a comprehensive benefit evaluation index system and evaluates the comprehensive benefits through case analysis. This paper also sorts out the distributed energy-related Chinese government policies from 2001 to 2017, and considers the scale of distributed energy development, then divides it into two development stages. The synergetic entropy is used to analyze the synergetic development degree of the two-stage distributed energy entities. The synergistic optimization strategy is proposed from the Chinese government side, power supply side, power grid side and user side, which provides theoretical methods and optimization suggestions for improving the comprehensive benefits of distributed energy and promoting sustainable development of energy.","2018","[('C61', 'Q40'), ('C61', 'H23'), ('C61', 'O13'), ('C61', 'L94'), ('C61', 'Q55'), ('C15', 'Q40'), ('C15', 'H23'), ('C15', 'O13'), ('C15', 'L94'), ('C15', 'Q55')]","['Q40', 'H23', 'C61', 'O13', 'C15', 'L94', 'Q55']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0277777777777777","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['Q40', 'H23', 'O13', 'L94', 'Q55']","['C61', 'C15']"

HIFA could increase the probability that children would have health insurance either by directly enrolling a child into a HIFA program or by creating a “spillover” effect from adults onto children by making parents of children already eligible for public programs eligible for HIFA. Data were drawn from the Current Population Survey from 2000 to 2007. The estimation approach was a probit model using a difference-in-differences approach. The authors find that the HIFA wavier demonstrations had no measureable effect on the uninsurance rate among children, either through direct eligibility or through a “spillover” effect from parental eligibility.

Instead of consumers choosing the quantity purchased given exogenous prices, it was suppliers who limited the quantity marketed and consumers’ choices established the market price.","2015","[('C22', 'D12'), ('C22', 'L11'), ('C22', 'I18'), ('C22', 'D22'), ('C22', 'Q13'), ('C13', 'D12'), ('C13', 'L11'), ('C13', 'I18'), ('C13', 'D22'), ('C13', 'Q13')]","['D12', 'L11', 'Q13', 'C22', 'D22', 'I18', 'C13']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.5","['D12', 'L11', 'I18', 'D22', 'Q13']","['C22', 'C13']"

Trade-off theory is based on the optimisation of a target debt ratio, whereas pecking order theory argues that decision-making is sequential and that firms prefer internal funding to debt, due to asymmetry of information. Unlike other studies devoted to French SMEs, estimates come from a dynamic panel model (Generalised Method of Moments) applied to mature businesses. Profitability, guarantees upon which access to credit is granted, and trade credit confirm trade-off theory. Relationships between debt and the lagged debt ratio, growth opportunities, credit risk and control over ownership support the pecking order theory, which passes better the tests. Hence, no unified theory of the capital structure has yet emerged.","2018","[('C23', 'G01'), ('C23', 'M21'), ('C23', 'G32'), ('C23', 'D92'), ('C23', 'E32'), ('C33', 'G01'), ('C33', 'M21'), ('C33', 'G32'), ('C33', 'D92'), ('C33', 'E32')]","['G01', 'M21', 'G32', 'D92', 'C23', 'E32', 'C33']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","1.0","['G01', 'M21', 'G32', 'E32']","['C23', 'C33']"

Its novelty is that it allows city size distributions to interact with socioeconomic variables. The contribution to the literature is twofold. One is a challenge to the conventional view that the proportionate growth dynamics underlies empirical rank–size regularities. It is shown that the city size distribution of a region can deviate substantially from a log-normal distribution with cross-regional and time variations, and that such variations can be explained by certain socioeconomic conditions that each region confronts at a particular time point. In addition, this study can pave the way for various research projects which need spatial distribution of global population at fine grid cell levels as key input. The model is applicable to the entire globe, including regions for which reliable sub-regional population datasets are limitedly available, and can be extended easily for predictive analysis.","2012","[('Y80', 'R12'), ('Y80', 'J11'), ('Y80', 'O18'), ('Y80', 'R15'), ('C21', 'R12'), ('C21', 'J11'), ('C21', 'O18'), ('C21', 'R15'), ('C13', 'R12'), ('C13', 'J11'), ('C13', 'O18'), ('C13', 'R15')]","['J11', 'Y80', 'O18', 'R12', 'C21', 'C13', 'R15']","False","False","False","False","False","False","","","0.0","0.0","0.0","1.0","['R12', 'J11', 'O18', 'R15']","['Y80', 'C21', 'C13']"

Attempts to use health insurance in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) are recognized as a powerful tool in achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC). However, continuous enrolment onto health insurance schemes and utilization of healthcare in these countries remain problematic due to varying factors. Empirical evidence on the influence of household sociodemographic factors on enrolment and subsequent utilization of healthcare is rare. This paper sought to examine how household profile influences the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) status and use of healthcare in a municipality of Ghana. Methods. A cross-sectional design with quantitative methods was conducted among a total of 380 respondents, selected through a multistage cluster sampling. Data were collected using a semistructured questionnaire. Data were analysed using descriptive and multiple logistics regression at 95% CI using STATA 14. Results. Overall, 57.9% of respondents were males, and average age was 34 years. Households’ profiles such as age, gender, education, marital status, ethnicity, and religion were key predictors of NHIS active membership. Compared with other age groups, 38–47 years (AOR 0.06) and 58 years and above (AOR = 0.01), widow, divorced families, Muslims, and minority ethnic groups were less likely to have NHIS active membership. However, females (AOR = 3.92), married couples (AOR = 48.9), and people educated at tertiary level consistently had their NHIS active. Proximate factors such as education, marital status, place of residence, and NHIS status were predictors of healthcare utilization. Conclusion. The study concludes that households’ proximate factors influence the uptake of NHIS policy and subsequent utilization of healthcare. Vulnerable population such as elderly, minority ethnic, and religious groups were less likely to renew their NHIS policy. The NHIS policy should revise the exemption bracket to wholly cover vulnerable groups such as minority ethnic and religious groups and elderly people at retiring age of 60 years.","2018","[('C25', 'O15'), ('C25', 'D12'), ('C25', 'J14'), ('C25', 'I12'), ('C25', 'I18'), ('C10', 'O15'), ('C10', 'D12'), ('C10', 'J14'), ('C10', 'I12'), ('C10', 'I18')]","['O15', 'D12', 'J14', 'I12', 'I18', 'C25', 'C10']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0068965517241379","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['O15', 'D12', 'J14', 'I12', 'I18']","['C25', 'C10']"

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the prevalence as well as the effective factors on facing catastrophic health expenditures (CHE) among gastrointestinal cancer patients and families in Kurdistan province in west of Iran after the implementation of Health Transformation Plan (HTP). Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional study was carried out on 189 households with gastrointestinal cancer patients in Kurdistan province in 2018. Data were collected using World Health Survey questionnaire. A method developed by World Health Organization with the threshold of 40 percent household’s capacity to pay was used in order to measure the proportion of households facing CHE. Also, logistic regression was applied for identifying the effective factors on household’s exposure to CHE. Data were analyzed using STATA version 13. Findings Almost 73 percent (72.7 percent) of the households ( n =117) faced the CHE. Not having supplementary health insurance (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 3.8; 95% confidence interval: 1.3–10.8 (and having low socio-economic status (AOR: 7.1; 95% CI: 1.8–28.1) were the significant factors affecting the households’ exposure to CHE. In total, 57 and 1 percent of the studied households reported that having a gastrointestinal cancer patient at home had a significant effect on refraining from using health services by other family members. Originality/value The proportion of the studied households facing CHE was very high. This may indicate the weakness of health system as well as health insurance or the weakness of HTP in financial protection of fragile population.","2019","[('C25', 'I10'), ('C25', 'D12'), ('C25', 'O53'), ('C25', 'H51'), ('C25', 'I13'), ('C93', 'I10'), ('C93', 'D12'), ('C93', 'O53'), ('C93', 'H51'), ('C93', 'I13')]","['C93', 'I10', 'D12', 'O53', 'C25', 'H51', 'I13']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['I10', 'D12', 'O53', 'H51', 'I13']","['C25', 'C93']"

We use Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) data to compare 2-year predicted mortality for Medicare enrollees in the HMO and FFS sectors using a sample selection model to control for observed beneficiaries characteristics and unobserved confounders. The difference in raw, unadjusted mortality probabilities was 0.5% (HMO lower). Correcting for numerous observed confounders resulted in a difference of -0.6% (HMO higher). Further adjustment for unobserved confounders resulted in an estimated difference of 3.7 and 4.2% (HMO lower), depending on the specification of geographic-fixed effects. The latter result (4.2%) was statistically significant and consistent with prior studies that did not adjust for unobserved confounding. Our findings suggest there may be unobserved confounders associated with adverse selection in the HMO sector, which had a large effect on our mortality estimates among HMO enrollees. An important topic for further research is to identify such confounders and explore their relationship to mortality. The methods presented in this paper represent a promising approach to comparing outcomes between the HMO and FFS sectors, but further research is warranted.","2010","[('C14', 'I11'), ('C14', 'H51'), ('C14', 'I12'), ('C14', 'I10'), ('C21', 'I11'), ('C21', 'H51'), ('C21', 'I12'), ('C21', 'I10'), ('C13', 'I11'), ('C13', 'H51'), ('C13', 'I12'), ('C13', 'I10')]","['C14', 'I10', 'I12', 'I11', 'H51', 'C21', 'C13']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.2318358832333988","0.3407855731225296","0.0","0.25","","","['I11', 'H51', 'I12', 'I10']","['C14', 'C21', 'C13']"

Perhaps based on an appeal to the central limit theorem, the stochastic component of performance has often been assumed to be a normal random variable. However, in the context of a racing sport, this assumption is problematic because the resulting model is the computationally difficult rank-ordered probit. Although a rank-ordered logit is a viable alternative, a Thurstonian paired-comparison model could also be applied. The purpose of this analysis was to compare the performance of the rank-ordered logit and Thurstonian paired-comparison models given the objective of ranking competitors based on ability. Monte Carlo simulations were used to generate race results based on a known ranking of competitors, assign rankings from the results of the two models, and judge performance based on Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Results suggest that in many applications, a Thurstonian model can outperform a rank-ordered logit if each competitor's performance is normally distributed.","2015","[('C93', 'Z20'), ('C93', 'L83'), ('C15', 'Z20'), ('C15', 'L83'), ('C25', 'Z20'), ('C25', 'L83'), ('C01', 'Z20'), ('C01', 'L83'), ('C51', 'Z20'), ('C51', 'L83')]","['C93', 'C15', 'C25', 'Z20', 'L83', 'C01', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","","","['Z20', 'L83']","['C93', 'C15', 'C25', 'C01', 'C51']"

We find that the wage gap is mostly due to firms paying higher wages per efficiency unit in West Germany and quantify a rich set of frictions preventing worker reallocation across space and across firms. We find that three spatial barriers impede East Germans' ability to migrate West: migration costs, a preference to live in the East, and fewer job opportunities received from the West. The estimated model highlights that the spatial barriers needed to generate the large wage gap between East and West are small relative to the frictions preventing the reallocation of labor across firms.

The case of cataract care"," Objective To identify differences between independent treatment centers (ITCs) and general hospitals (GHs) regarding costs, quality of care, and efficiency. Data Sources Anonymous claims data (2013‐2015) were used. We also obtained quality indicators from a semipublic platform. Study Design This study uses a comparative multilevel analysis, controlling for case mix, to evaluate the performance of ITCs and GHs for patients diagnosed with cataract. Data Collection Reimbursement claims were extracted from existing claims databases of the largest Dutch health insurer. Quality indicators were obtained by external agencies through a mixed‐mode survey. Principal Findings There are no stark differences in complexity of cases for cataract care. ITCs seem to perform surgeries more frequently per care pathway, but conduct a lower number of health care activities per surgical claim. Total average costs are lower in ITCs compared with GHs, but when adjusted for case mix, the differences in costs are lower. The findings with the adjusted quality differences suggest that ITCs outperform GHs on patient satisfaction, but patients’ outcomes are similar.

One type of mutual fund that attracts many investors was the equity mutual funds. Equity mutual fund a type of mutual funds that most part of the investment consists of stocks in the capital market so the risk rate was higher than the other types of mutual funds. For its different characteristic, the measurement for equity funds performance did not be same with other types of mutual funds. As a stock portfolio, equity mutual funds can measure with portfolio measurement methods such as Sharpe Index, Treynor Ratio, Jensen Index, Adjusted Sharpe Index, Adjusted Jensen Index, and Sortino Ratio. This study was conducted by using all of those performance measurements as most research in Indonesia was conducted by using limited performance measurements (focusing on Sharpe Index, Treynor Ratio, and Jensen Index). This study aims to evaluate the performance of 42 equity mutual funds available in Indonesia by employing Sharpe Index, Treynor Ratio, Jensen Index, Adjusted Sharpe Index (ASI), Adjusted Jensen Index (AJI), and Sortino Ratio because most previous researches in Indonesian setting disregards ASI and AJI. In general, it was concluded that the SAM Indonesian Equity was the best-performing equity fund during the study period. It was further found that most equity mutual fund studied have been well diversified.

Both are under serious threat because of human intrusion and as a result, it is likely that present and future projects will affect threatened and endangered species. Thus, it is important to account for these impacts when evaluating and conducting cost and benefit analyses of projects. Due to their public good character and non-tradability, the total economic value of threatened and endangered species cannot be reflected by a market price and therefore, alternative approaches (stated preference method) are needed to determine their monetary value. This paper reviews and compares the valuation literature on threatened and endangered animals and conducts a meta-analysis regression to identify explanatory variables for the variation in willingness to pay for threatened and endangered species. The main findings of the meta-analysis show that the interaction of the level of threat and charisma have a positive effect on willingness to pay. Furthermore, developed countries have a higher willingness to pay compared to developing countries. Similarly, visitors of conservation sites have higher willingness to pay than residents. The provided example of a benefit transfer of the estimated function shows the practicability of our results.","2018","[('C93', 'D61'), ('C93', 'H41'), ('C93', 'Q51'), ('C93', 'Q57'), ('C93', 'Q26'), ('C83', 'D61'), ('C83', 'H41'), ('C83', 'Q51'), ('C83', 'Q57'), ('C83', 'Q26')]","['D61', 'C93', 'H41', 'Q51', 'Q57', 'Q26', 'C83']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.1","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['D61', 'H41', 'Q51', 'Q57', 'Q26']","['C93', 'C83']"

Usually, this quantity is very difficult to estimate from censored survival data with a limited follow-up period. The paper develops estimation procedures for a time-shift survival model that, provided model assumptions are met, gives a reliable estimate of incremental life expectancy without extrapolation beyond the study period. Methods for inference are developed both for individual patient data and when only published Kaplan-Meier curves are available. Through simulation, the estimators are shown to be close to unbiased and constructed confidence intervals are shown to have close to nominal coverage for small to moderate sample sizes.

Specifically, this paper aims to examine the empirical behaviors of the oil prices, the domestic resource gaps, and the fiscal and external breakeven oil prices along with their influence on the economy of Saudi Arabia in order to determine the oil-economic gain/loss (OEG/L) and its influences on the Saudi Arabia economy over the period of 2008 to 2018. This study uses exploratory research design, with both linear and nonlinear regression models. This paper finds the oil prices, the domestic resources gaps, and the fiscal and external breakeven oil prices exert significant influences on the economic growth in Saudi Arabia. In addition, the fiscal breakeven oil price is considerably high in Saudi Arabia and has a marginal OEG/L of USD 2.3582 per barrel. Moreover, it is observed that the oil price has an irregular and unpredictable movement behavior and co-moved with the domestic resource gaps in Saudi Arabia. The findings implies that the economy diversification in Saudi Arabia could be achieved by setting policy on improving non-oil sectors and encouraging private sector involvement.","2018","[('C10', 'Q43'), ('C10', 'F43'), ('C10', 'O13'), ('C10', 'E62'), ('C10', 'E17'), ('C51', 'Q43'), ('C51', 'F43'), ('C51', 'O13'), ('C51', 'E62'), ('C51', 'E17')]","['Q43', 'F43', 'O13', 'E62', 'C10', 'E17', 'C51']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","['Q43', 'F43', 'O13', 'E62', 'E17']","['C10', 'C51']"

In this paper, we refine this argument to emphasize not just the volume of these rents but also their diversity and the extent to which they can act as substitutes for one another. Specifically, a greater number of distinct sources of rents, and a more equitable distribution among them, provide an important hedge against any sudden change in the ability of autocracies to capture these rents and should lead to more stable regimes. We use a procedure from the literature on market concentration to develop a single measure, termed rent diversification, which captures these characteristics. We then use this new measure in a quantitative analysis examining the likelihood of regime failure. Our findings provide strong evidence that autocracies with more diversified rent portfolios are much less likely to collapse.","2015","[('C31', 'P16'), ('C31', 'Q32'), ('C31', 'O17'), ('C31', 'P26'), ('C31', 'D72'), ('C10', 'P16'), ('C10', 'Q32'), ('C10', 'O17'), ('C10', 'P26'), ('C10', 'D72')]","['P16', 'C31', 'Q32', 'C10', 'O17', 'P26', 'D72']","False","False","False","False","False","False","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.0","0.25","0.0625","['P16', 'Q32', 'O17', 'P26', 'D72']","['C31', 'C10']"

Although the greedy algorithm is computationally superior, we argue that the randomized rounding algorithm has an advantage from a social choice point of view.Further, we demonstrate that computing any reasonable approximation of the ranking produced by Dodgson's rule is NP-hard. This result provides a complexity-theoretic explanation of sharp discrepancies that have been observed in the Social Choice Theory literature when comparing Dodgson elections with simpler voting rules.Finally, we show that the problem of calculating the Young score is NP-hard to approximate by any factor.
